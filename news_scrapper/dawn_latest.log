 'content': 'Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally unveiled the National '
            'Eco\xadnomic Transforma\xadtion Plan 2024-29 on Tuesday called '
            '“Uraan Pakistan: Homegrown National Economic Plan”, with the '
            'promise to revive the country’s economy. The five-year plan aims '
            'to address key economic challenges thro\xadugh a targeted '
            'framework called the “Five Es” — Exports; E-Pakis\xadtan; Equity '
            'and Empo\xadwerment; Environment, Food and Water Security; and '
            'Energy and Infrastructure. In April, PM Shehbaz had called for '
            'the creation of a comprehensive five-year strategy to double the '
            'country’s exports and underscored the importance of a '
            'collaborative approach, asking the Min\xadis\xadtry of Trade to '
            'devise the export strategy in consultation with successful '
            'entrepreneurs and stakeholders. The ceremony to announce the plan '
            'was held in Islamabad today, with speeches by the prime minister, '
            'Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Planning Minister Ahsan '
            'Iqbal, and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. Addressing the event, '
            'PM Shehbaz commended the presentations by the aforementioned '
            'ministers and said, “The crux is that in the last nine months, we '
            'negotiated huge challenges [and] difficulties and through '
            'untiring efforts of the federal and provincial governments and '
            'our partners in prosperity and progress, we have been able to '
            'achieve macroeconomic stability. “But this is just the beginning '
            'of a long journey which would entail sacrifice, blood and sweat '
            'to achieve economic growth and find our lost place among '
            'nations,” he added. The premier said achieving growth required '
            'everyone to come together to work and march forward with “unity '
            'of thought and action”.      The prime minister explained the '
            'challenges his government faced on the economic front when it '
            'came into power and said the country was forced to go for another '
            'programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He said it '
            'was a moment to ponder why the country had to resort to another '
            'IMF bailout, pointing out losses of state-owned enterprises, the '
            'circular debt, and corruption. Outlining how growth would be '
            'achieved for the economy, the prime minister said that inputs '
            'would have to be made cheaper, investment would have to be '
            'encouraged, and import curbs would have to be removed to '
            'encourage competition, efficiency, and export-led growth. '
            '“Export-led growth is the ultimate saviour of Pakistan. You need '
            'to earn dollars that is only possible through exports,” he said, '
            'adding that the same was the central pivot for the new reform '
            'package as well. The premier also stressed the need to promote '
            'and expand the digital and technology sectors, particularly the '
            'use and adoption of artificial intelligence. PM Shehbaz went on '
            'to say there was a need to create political harmony to forward '
            'privatisation efforts to prevent losses. He said there was a need '
            'to reduce inefficiency in state-owned enterprises, pointing '
            'towards unsuccessful efforts to privatise the national carrier. '
            '“We faced a setback in PIA’s privatisation. Facts should be '
            'accepted. There is no doubt our team made full efforts and we are '
            'doing so again,” he said. The premier said the government would '
            'have to aim for an annual investment target of $10 billion, '
            'adding that this was “easier said than done”.\n'
            'He said foreign investment was only possible through facilitating '
            'local investment first, and that measures were being taken in '
            'this regard. During his speech, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said, '
            '“Petty politics has to be buried” if Pakistan was to achieve '
            'progress. “If you remember we talked about a charter of economy '
            'multiple times between 2013-2017 but it fell on deaf ears,” Dar '
            'said. He said Pakistan had to face huge losses and it “Fell from '
            'the 24th to the 47th largest economy”. Dar said he believed '
            'Pakistan could still join the G-20 club of nations, adding that '
            'the “goal is very conveniently achievable provided we remain on '
            'track.” He added that ownership had to be taken by everyone for '
            'the economic roadmap. Meanwhile, the finance minister recapped '
            '“the significant macroeconomic progress made” in the last 12-14 '
            'months. “We have to move towards growth, but it has to be '
            'sustainable growth, we cannot continue to be in boom and bust '
            'cycles,” he said. “Because we’ve been an import-based economy, as '
            'soon as we go above four per cent, we get into a balance of '
            'payment problems, then we run back to the institution and say: '
            '‘this will be the last fund programme’. “We need to move towards '
            'growth, under the leadership of PM Shehbaz, but on the back of '
            'fundamental reforms which have remained elusive for us and are '
            'imperative for sustained growth.” He said that the journey '
            'towards long-term prosperity warranted homegrown solutions, which '
            'is why PM Shehbaz established the Homegrown Reform Economic '
            'Committee back in May. “That committee extensively reviewed '
            'national economic plans, including the 13th five-year plan '
            'prepared by the Ministry of Planning and duly approved by '
            'National Economic Council and the economic manifestos of various '
            'political parties.” Aurangzeb explained the three main pillars of '
            'the plan: stimulating private investment, which was key to '
            'getting more jobs, higher incomes and a low cost of living '
            'through a more competitive economy. He emphasised that '
            'implementation of the measures was key to the plan, not just '
            'planning. The minister also noted that under Manmohan Singh as '
            'premier, India progressed but Pakistan could not do so in the '
            'comparable timeframe. The finance minister said the second pillar '
            'of the economy was stimulating exports, a key mechanism to drive '
            'productivity growth, and the third was optimising public '
            'finances, which was central to stability and sustained growth. '
            '“There is going to be a separate tax policy unit which is in the '
            'process of being created, which will independently report to the '
            'Ministry of Finance. So we’re separating policy from collection. '
            '“This tax policy unit will be managed by people of the private '
            'and public sectors so that we can implement policy continuity. '
            'Tax leakages will be plugged through the use of data analytics, '
            'and the privatisation process will be accelerated.” Explaining '
            'the deliverables of the plan, he said they were achieving a '
            'sustainable GDP growth of 6pc by 2028, creating one million '
            'additional jobs annually, securing additional $10bn private '
            'investment per year and hitting an export target of $60bn by '
            'FY2028. Aurangzeb emphasised that there was “no dearth of policy '
            'prescriptions in Pakistan; we have known the what and why for the '
            'longest time, we just don’t do it. This time round the plan is '
            'accompanied by a comprehensive implementation mechanism.” Earlier '
            'today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the reform '
            'package would significantly improve citizens’ lives, stimulate '
            'growth and strengthen the economy. Tarar said that the economy '
            'had moved from the verge of default to stability and was now on '
            'the path to progress, highlighting improvements in all economic '
            'indicators. He described the reform-driven plan as being focused '
            'on a “Made in Pakistan” approach and stressed its vital role in '
            'fostering economic growth and bringing positive change to the '
            'people of Pakistan. Tarar said the economic reform agenda was '
            'designed to accelerate the country’s development and ensure the '
            'prosperity of its citizens.',

            'the four places that are left [to be cleared], we will clear the '

            'the roads in Parachinar”. Safvi went on to say that the protest '

            'development, harnessing the power of digital transformation to '
            'turn Pakistan into a techno-economy, ensuring environmental, food '

            'emphasised their critical role in addressing Pakistan’s '
            'challenges and shaping its future. “Civil service is not just a '
            'profession; it is a mission,” he said. The minister identified '
            'peace, political stability, policy continuity and commitment to '
            'reforms as key factors for sustainable development. “Governments '
            'will come and go, but civil servants are the constant force '
            'steering the nation towards progress,” he said, urging officers '
            'to maintain integrity and a reputation of excellence. He '
            'encouraged them to reflect on how other nations have outpaced '
            'Pakistan in development and called for a unified approach to '
            'overcome the country’s challenges. “If we aim to achieve an '
            'honourable position by 2047, civil servants must commit to these '

            'Pakistan-China   during the project’s first concrete pouring '

            'fatalities and 2267 injuries among civilians, security personnel, '
            'and outlaws. This tally of casualties stemmed from 1166 terror '

            'the country’s security\n'
            'landscape. Compared to last year, these figures mark an over 66pc '

            'injuries (2267 vs 1462) and around 49pc more incidents (1166 vs '
            '784). KP and Balochistan accounted for 94pc of all fatalities and '
            '89pc of all incidents across the country. While KP suffered most '
            'of the fatalities (over 63pc) recorded this year, followed by '
            'Balochistan (31pc), the highest  , compared to last year, '

            'polio cases in the province, following a 23-month gap since the '
            'last reported case in February 2024. As of now, 27 polio cases '
            'have been reported across various districts, including Chaman, '

            'Noshki, Loralai, Pishin, Kharan, Jaffarabad, and Chagai. The '
            'seven-day-long campaign aims to   the rise in polio cases and the '
            'presence of the poliovirus in environmental samples. A total of '
            '11,600 vaccination teams will participate, including 9,326 mobile '

            'ensure that children under five receive the necessary polio '
            'drops. Speaking at the ceremony, CM Bugti urged parents to '
            'prioritise polio vaccination to protect their children from '
            'lifelong paralysis and disability. He said all available '
            'resources are being mobilised to ensure the complete eradication '
            'of polio and to make the province polio-free. Security measures '
            'have been strengthened to ensure maximum coverage during the '
            'campaign. “The polio campaign is critical to prevent the spread '
            'of the virus and protect our children,” said CM Bugti. He '
            'emphasised that, in addition to the polio vaccine, the campaign '
            'would also ensure that children complete their routine '
            'immunisation against other dangerous diseases like measles and '
            'pneumonia. Given the presence of the poliovirus in the '
            'environment, the chief minister urged parents to cooperate with '
            'vaccination teams, stressing that their participation is crucial '
            'to safeguard their children’s health and prevent further spread '
            'of the virus. The initiative comes amid growing concerns over the '
            'virus’s persistence in the province. Balochistan’s anti-polio '

 'content': 'KARACHI: The commissioner of Karachi has reduced the prices of '
            'various varieties of flour but retailers, instead of implementing '
            'the new rates, are charging more from consumers.   On December '
            '26, the wholesale and retail prices of flour No2.5 were reduced '
            'from Rs90 and Rs94 to Rs85 and Rs89 per kg.   The flour No2.5 is '
            'the one which is mostly used by tandoor operators. The price '
            'reduction was Rs5 per kg.   The new wholesale and retail rates of '
            'fine flour have been notified at Rs92 and Rs96 per kg as compared '
            'to Rs95 and Rs99 per kg, respectively.   Retail chakki flour '
            'price has been cut by Rs10 to Rs105 per kg.   Surprisingly, the '
            'December 26 notification does not carry the ex-mill rates of '
            'flour No2.5 and fine flours, while the same were prominent in the '
            'previous lists.   On June 5, 2024, wholesale and retail rates of '
            'flour No2.5 were Rs91 and Rs95 per kg. The wholesale and retail '
            'rates of fine flour were Rs95 and Rs100 per kg, while chakki '
            'flour retail rate was Rs115 per kg.   A market survey revealed '
            'that consumers were paying Rs110-120 per kg for flour No2.5 and '
            'fine flour, showing a massive price difference between the '
            'official and market rates.   “One of the reasons of retailers’ '
            'fleecing consumers is lack of display of official price lists at '
            'retail shops,” said Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association '
            '(KWGA) chairman Rauf Ibrahim.   He said it was the government’s '
            'responsibility to publish price list at mass level instead of '
            'posting the list on social media.   In addition to the absence of '
            'a price list, the officials of the city government also did not '
            'pay any visit to markets to impose fines on shopkeepers for '
            'overcharging, he added.   He said that the commissioner and his '
            'team should also pay visits to wholesale markets and ensure '
            'official price implementation.   “Keeping in view the local and '
            'imported wheat rates, which are Rs74 and Rs70 per kg, '
            'respectively, official prices of various flour varieties can be '
            'further cut by Rs2 per kg,” he suggested.   Prior to the new '
            'price list which was issued on December 26, the commissioner of '
            'Karachi took more than six months to announce flour rates on '
            'December 17.   Amid no price fixing for branded flour varieties, '
            'the 5kg Ashrafi and Bake Parlour fine flour bag is available at '
            'Rs630 while 5kg chakki branded flour bag is selling at Rs600.   '
            'Grocery rates   While no retailers have been seen displaying the '
            'official price list of vegetables at their shops, consumers are '
            'also seeing huge price differences in other items.   For example, '
            'the official rates of new potato and onion are Rs92 but they are '
            'available at Rs100-150 per kg in the markets.   Tomato is selling '
            'at Rs200-220 per kg as against the official rate of Rs173 per '
            'kg.   The official rate of sugar is fixed at Rs125 per kg while '
            'retailers are selling the sweetener at Rs135-145 per kg.   The '
            'market retail rates of masoor, moong, mash and gram pulse are '
            'Rs280-320, Rs330-340, Rs440-520 and Rs360-420 per kg as against '

            'thousands of children and killing at least 150 children this year '
            'in the province, it has emerged. However, the health department '
            'data confirmed the deaths of 132 children this year with more '
            'than 13,000 suspected and 6,670 confirmed cases. Surprisingly, it '
            'shows only three deaths in Karachi. The year saw 149 outbreaks '
            'across the province with 18 outbreaks reported in Karachi alone. '
            'Dadu has seen the highest number of outbreaks (21) followed by '
            'Tharparkar (20) and Khairpur (10). From Nov 1 till Dec 14, a '
            'total of 350 suspected cases and 155 confirmed cases had been '
            'reported in the province. A total of 749,670 children were '
            'vaccinated against the disease. Speaking to Dawn, health experts '
            'said that cases of measles were on the rise in the city with the '
            'onset of winter following a brief ‘respite’, while warning about '
            'a sharp increase in cases in subsequent weeks. “For the last two '
            'to three weeks, measles cases have increased. Currently, we have '
            '10 admitted children affected by the disease,” a senior doctor at '
            'the government-run Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital & Research '
            'Centre (SIDHRC) said, adding that children were reporting with '
            'complications, indicating their delayed arrival at the facility. '
            'The doctors at the hospital also pointed out that some of the '
            'patients were not responding to medication, probably due to their '
            'malnourished status. The hospital’s data showed that 65 children '
            'had lost their lives to diphtheria (31) and measles (34), both '
            'vaccine-preventable diseases, this year. A total of 829 children '
            'have been admitted with measles (713) and diphtheria (116) so '
            'far. Officials at the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi and the '
            'National Institute of Child Health (NICH) didn’t respond to '
            'requests for data on measles. Senior paediatricians working in '
            'the private sector also confirmed a gradual increase in cases of '
            'measles and said that they were seeing four to five cases of '
            'children daily presenting with clear clinical signs of measles. '
            'The recurrence of the viral infection, they point out, is being '
            'observed following a significant drop in cases of the viral '
            'infection for a few months. However, they don’t describe this '
            'disease pattern as unusual and say that it happens every year in '
            'winter during which people tend to remain indoors and keep their '
            'houses warm by closing all sources of natural ventilation. '
            'International studies, they say, have indicated a strong '
            'association between ventilation and air movements in buildings '
            'and transmission and spread of infectious diseases such as '
            'measles, tuberculosis and influenza. “This year, cases of measles '
            'seemed to have broken all previous records. The numbers were so '
            'high that even the word ‘high’ can’t describe the severity and '
            'enormity of the situation,” said senior paediatrician Dr Ved '
            'Vaswani, currently associated with Burhani Hospital and '
            'Al-Mustafa Medical Centre, adding that every third child was '
            'reporting with measles until a few months ago. According to him, '
            'measles is now being reported again in children below nine months '
            'of age and even in vaccinated children. “They might have got '
            'infected due to their compromised health. This viral infection is '
            'more prevalent in thickly populated, crowded areas with poor '
            'hygienic conditions and low literacy levels, especially in female '
            'population,” he said, underscoring the need for public awareness '
            'of the disease that gets complicated, if early signs are ignored. '
            'Dr Khalid Shafi of the Pakistan Paediatric Association held the '
            'parents solely responsible for child mortality and morbidity due '
            'to vaccine-preventable diseases. “The majority of children '
            'falling victim to polio, diphtheria or measles are unvaccinated. '
            'This pocket of child population is a persistent threat to the '
            'community.” He regretted that parents were negligent towards '
            'their child’s fundamental health rights. “The EPI programme '
            'offers free of cost vaccines against 12 major diseases, including '
            'measles, polio and diphtheria. It’s unfortunate that parents are '
            'not making use of this facility.” Highlighting government '
            'efforts, EPI programme director Dr Muhammad Naeem said that the '
            'affected children were those who had missed their doses during '
            'the Covid-19 pandemic. “We have significantly increased '
            'surveillance and case response activities. The staff is being '
            'trained and facilitated to increase accessibility while a major '
            'initiative has been taken to immunise children who have missed '
            'their doses during the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said, adding that '

            'afterward for an in-camera briefing on the issue. He said that '
            'the regrouping of terrorists in the province was a failure of '
            'intelligence agencies. Mr Swati said that instead of “holding a '
            'presser about a political party,” the director-general of '
            'Inter-Services Public Relations should inform people about how '
            'terrorists continued to infiltrate despite border fencing. The '

            'said military operations against terrorism were carried out in '
            'the past across the province, displacing thousands of people, but '
            'as those residents had returned to their homes, there was a talk '
            'about fresh military offensives in the same areas, fearing their '
            'displacement. “There is a lack of trust between elected and '
            'military leadership,” he insisted. Earlier, members of both '
            'treasury and opposition benches declared the law and order '
            'situation in the province alarming and sought a briefing from '
            'authorities about it. Member of the opposition Awami National '
            'Party Mohammad Nisar complained that the mainstream media never '
            'covered the grievances of tribal residents. He insisted that '
            'security forces had ordered people in Bajaur district, Tirah in '
            'Khyber district and Waziristan district to evacuate for new '
            'military operations. The lawmaker said that 21 such offensives '
            'were carried out in the past, leading to claims about the '
            'elimination of private militias. He claimed that authorities had '
            'decided about another military operation in the tribal region '
            'amid strong opposition from residents. “People in merged tribal '
            'districts are not ready to leave their homes again,” he said, '
            'proposing intelligence-based operations against terrorists. Mr '
            'Nisar questioned why unrest persisted when Afghanistan had a '
            'pro-Pakistan government. He alleged vested interests profited '
            'from instability in the country. The MPA requested the speaker to '
            'call the provincial police chief to the house for a briefing on '
            'the security situation and said an in-camera briefing by military '
            'officers should also be held. Member of the opposition PML-N '
            'Jalal Khan said the law and order situation in the province was '
            'alarming, so the treasury and the opposition should be on the '
            'same page on the strategy to address it. MPA Abdul Ghani from the '
            'treasury benches said that development was worthless until the '
            'province had peace. He also supported the call for briefing by '
            'authorities on the law and order situation and said people of the '
            'province won’t accept any decision from Islamabad. Livestock '
            'minister Fazal Hakim questioned where terrorists were coming in '
            'and where they hid. He said if those responsible for protecting '
            'public life couldn’t deliver, they should step down. Treasury '
            'member Shafiullah Jan insisted that the province hadn’t witnessed '
            'terrorism for almost three years nor had any terrorists resettled '
            'there. He said the military claimed to have nothing to do with '
            'politics but the pressers held by its officers were focused on '
            'the PTI and its incarcerated leader, Imran Khan, so they would '
            'face criticism. Mr Jan said the PTI founder was “standing like a '
            'rock against all odds.” Also in the session, member of the '
            'opposition JUI-F Rehana Ismail insisted that the government '
            'boasted about 356 dams but actually, they’re mini hydropower '
            'projects, with 216 producing power at the moment. Law minister '

            'projects had been successfully executed by the provincial '
            'government to produce over 60 megawatts of electricity. As the '

            'Member of the opposition JUI-F Adnan Khan suggested that all '

            'the recent example was an inquiry into procurement of medicines '

            'in corruption of Rs1.9 billion but no action was taken against '
            'them so far. The 16-page inquiry report was compiled in a period '
            'of more than one month. The inquiry was led by special assistant '
            'to chief minister on anti-corruption. Other member of the inquiry '
            'team included additional chief secretary, secretaries of '
            'establishment and finance departments, principal secretary to '

            'negligence and misuse of authority, causing losses to national '

            'authority for launching criminal proceedings and making recovery '

            'Minister Secretariat to act upon its recommendations but so far '
            'no action was taken and the officials continued to perform their '
            'duty as usual as if nothing was happened. “This is a big scandal '

            'bow to the pressure of caretaker government to abet corruption in '
            'purchase of Rs5 billion medicines. After he called it a day, the '

            'Monday. The Rs10.2 billion project was launched in 2022 through '
            'the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) by the Capital '
            'Development Authority (CDA) and it was supposed to be completed '
            'in March this year. Later, the deadline was extended till '
            'December 30. Sources said the contractor, National Logistic Cell '
            '(NLC), was not able to speed up the work because of a lack of '
            'funds. “Yes, today our extended deadline has expired. The project '
            'is facing delays mainly because of funding,” said a CDA officer. '
            'He said the federal government should look into this matter; '
            'otherwise, it could face cost escalation charges as well. '
            'According to the CDA officials, the shortage of funds was the '
            'major reason behind the delay. So far, out of total Rs10.2 '
            'billion, less than Rs3.5 billion has been released for the '
            'project. A few months ago, the contractor had informed the CDA '
            'that inadequate and piecemeal funding was one of the main reasons '
            'for the delay in work. The NLC also called for an implementation '

            'Engineering Council (PEC) and the Executive Committee of the '
            'National Economic Committee (Ecnec) in 2023. For this mega '
            'project, the government in fiscal year 2024-25 earmarked only '
            'Rs400 million, which showed that the government was not '
            'interested in getting this project completed in this fiscal year. '
            'Out of the allocated Rs 400 million, only Rs 140 million was '
            'released during the first two quarters of this fiscal year. The '
            'project was started by the PTI government. Initially, the '
            'government had earmarked over Rs1 billion, but in the fiscal year '
            '2022-23 only Rs350 million were set aside for it. Then the PDM '
            'government released Rs1.3 billion, and in the fiscal year 2023-24 '
            'only Rs400 million were earmarked. Out of it, during the first '
            'two quarters, Rs 140 million was released. Under the first phase '

            'services and directed deputy commissioners of Rawalpindi, Attock, '
            'Chakwal, Jhelum and Murree to ensure proper procedure is followed '
            'and NOC obtained from the relevant deputy commissioner. He issued '
            'directions while presiding over a review meeting of development '
            'works held at the Commissioner’s Office in Rawalpindi. RDA '
            'Director General Kinza Murtaza, Parks and Horticulture Authority '
            'Director General Ahmed Hassan Ranjha and other concerned '
            'officials attended the meeting in person while deputy '
            'commissioners of Attock, Jhelum, Chakwal and Murree participated '
            'through video link. The commissioner directed the deputy '
            'commissioners to make an immediate assessment of the ongoing '
            'development schemes in their districts and submit a detailed '
            'report to the director development of Rawalpindi Division. He '
            'said deputy commissioners should ensure immediate completion of '
            'public welfare projects which were facing delay due to minor '
            'reasons. He asked them to write urgent letters to the relevant '
            'forums regarding pending schemes. Taking notice of digging of '
            'roads by different departments for municipal service, the '
            'commissioner took strict notice of the complaints raised by the '
            'public that complete and functional roads were being dug up and '
            'not filled. He strictly instructed that in future no department '
            'would dig up the road without obtaining NOC from the deputy '
            'commissioner. If digging of road is inevitable for provision of '
            'any municipal service, the concerned department will deposit the '
            'money for repair and construction of that road first and than get '
            'NOC from deputy commissioners. Moreover, efforts should be made '
            'to ensure that the provision of municipal services remain outside '
            'the roads, he said. The commissioner further said that a meeting '
            'should be held every second day to review the progress of '
            'Rawalpindi’s mega projects including Rawalpindi Ring Road, '
            'Daducha Dam, Leh Nullah, Kutchery Chowk, Azad Patan Road and '
            'Dream Project. He directed that tasks should be assigned to the '
            'departments with timelines so that their performance can be '
            'checked accordingly. While issuing orders to improve the '
            'monitoring of the ongoing development projects, he said that '
            '“test kits” should be installed along with the audit of projects '
            'by the third party. “If substandard work is proven, the '
            'construction company will be blacklisted for future government '
            'projects,” he added. Mr Khattak said timely completion of '
            'development schemes should be ensured under the direction of '
            'Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. “Any negligence in the SOPs '
            'of the projects will not be tolerated. Officers should not '
            'compromise on materials in projects, and contractors who do not '
            'show seriousness in work should be dismissed after three '
            'warnings,” he added. The commissioner directed that the allocated '
            'funds of PHA in the development schemes should be released '
            'immediately so that beautification work in the city and the '
            'restoration of green belts can be started simultaneously.',

            'ten hottest years on record have happened in the last ten years, '
            'including 2024,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in '
            'his New Year message. “This is climate breakdown — in real time. '
            'We must exit this road to ruin — and we have no time to lose. In '

            'countries, causing heartbreak to communities on every continent. '

            'Indian Ocean. Intense heat scorched dozens of countries, with '
            'temperatures topping 50 °C on a number of occasions. Wildfires '

 'content': 'GENEVA: The WHO chief called on Monday for the immediate release '
            'of Hossam Abu Safiyeh, director of Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital, '
            'who is   by Israel’s military following a major   on the '
            'facility. The Friday-Saturday assault on Kamal Adwan in Beit '
            'Lahia left northern Gaza’s last major health facility out of '
            'service and emptied of patients, the World Health Organisation '
            'said. “Hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds and '
            'the health system is under severe threat,” WHO director-general '
            'Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X. “Kamal Adwan Hospital in '
            'northern Gaza is out of service following the raid, forced '
            'patient and staff evacuation and the detention of its director. '
            'His whereabouts are unknown. We call for his immediate release.” '
            'Israel’s military said on Sunday that its forces had killed '
            'approximately 20 Palestinians and apprehended 240 in the raid, '
            'calling it one of its “largest operations” conducted in the '
            'territory. The military also said forces had detained Abu '
            'Safiyeh, suspecting him of being a Hamas fighter. When asked if '
            'he had been transferred to Israeli territory for further '
            'questioning, the military did not offer an immediate comment. '
            'Tedros said the patients in critical condition at Kamal Adwan had '
            'been moved to the Indonesian Hospital, “which is itself out of '
            'function”. “Amid ongoing chaos in northern Gaza, WHO and partners '
            'today delivered basic medical and hygiene supplies, food and '
            'water to Indonesian Hospital and transferred 10 critical patients '
            'to Al-Shifa Hospital,” he said. “We urge Israel to ensure their '
            'health care needs and rights are upheld.” He said seven patients '
            'along with 15 caregivers and health workers remained at the '
            '“severely damaged” Indonesian Hospital, “which has no ability to '
            'provide care”. “Al-Ahli Hospital and Al-Wafa Rehabilitation '
            'Hospital in Gaza City also faced attacks today and both are '
            'damaged,” Tedros added. “We repeat: stop attacks on hospitals. '
            'People in Gaza need access to health care. Humanitarians need '
            'access to provide health aid.” The International Committee of the '
            'Red Cross said on Monday the healthcare system in northern Gaza '
            'had been “obliterated” by fighting in the conflict, with '
            'hospitals rendered “completely inoperable”. “Repeated hostilities '
            'in and around hospitals have obliterated the healthcare system in '
            'northern Gaza, putting civilians at an unacceptably grave risk of '
            'going without lifesaving care,” the ICRC said in a statement. It '
            'called for the respect and protection of medical facilities in '
            'line with international humanitarian law. “This protection is a '
            'legal obligation and a moral imperative to preserve human life,” '
            'it added, saying hospitals were a lifeline for those sick or '
            'wounded in conflict. The Al-Awda Hospital, previously supported '
            'by the ICRC with supplies, was now absorbing more pressure as one '
            'of the few functioning medical facilities in northern Gaza, the '
            'Geneva-based organisation said. The ICRC said it remained '
            'committed to supporting healthcare services wherever possible, '
            'including doing what it could to ensure the protection of medical '
            'responders and civilian access to health care, as well as '
            'facilitating movements of medical personnel and equipment. The '
            'health ministry in Gaza said on Monday that 27 people were killed '
            'in the Palestinian territory in the past 24 hours, taking the '
            'overall death toll of the war to 45,541. The ministry also said '
            'in a statement that at least 108,338 people had been wounded in '
            'more than 14 months of conflict. Meanwhile, the Palestinian '
            'Authority’s ministry for detainees and the Palestinian Prisoners’ '
            'Club announced on Monday that they had received reports of the '
            'deaths of five Gazans in Israeli detention. Amani Sarahna, a '

 'content': 'MUAN COUNTY: South Korea’s acting President Choi Sang-mok on '
            'Monday ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country’s '
            'entire airline operation as investigators worked to identify '
            'victims and find out what caused the   air disaster on South '
            'Korean soil. All 175 passengers and four of the six crew were   '
            'when a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 belly-landed and skidded off the '
            'end of the runway at Muan International Airport, erupting in a '
            'fireball as it slammed into a wall. Two crew members were pulled '
            'out alive. The top priority for now is identifying the victims, '
            'supporting their families and treating the two survivors, Choi '
            'told a disaster management meeting in Seoul. “Even before the '
            'final results are out, we ask that officials transparently '
            'disclose the accident investigation process and promptly inform '
            'the bereaved families,” he said. “As soon as the accident '
            'recovery is conducted, the transport ministry is requested to '
            'conduct an emergency safety inspection of the entire aircraft '
            'operation system to prevent recurrence of aircraft accidents,” he '
            'said. As a first step, the transport ministry announced plans to '
            'conduct a special inspection of all 101 Boeing 737-800 aircraft '
            'operated by South Korean airliners beginning on Monday, focusing '
            'on the maintenance record of key components. Jeju Air flight '
            '7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok, was trying to '
            'land shortly after 9am (0000 GMT) on Sunday at the airport in the '
            'south of the country. Investigators are examining bird strikes, '
            'whether any of the aircraft’s control systems were disabled, and '
            'the apparent rush by the pilots to attempt a landing soon after '
            'declaring an emergency as possible factors in the crash, fire and '
            'transportation officials have said. Experts say many questions '
            'remain, including why the plane, powered by two CFM 56-7B26 '
            'engines, appeared to be travelling so fast and why its landing '
            'gear did not appear to be down when it skidded down the runway '
            'and into a concrete embankment. CFM International is a joint '
            'venture between GE Aerospace and France’s Safran. On Monday, '
            'transport ministry officials said as the pilots made a scheduled '
            'approach, they told air traffic control that the aircraft had '
            'suffered a bird strike, shortly after the control tower gave them '
            'a warning birds were spotted in the vicinity. The pilots then '
            'issued a Mayday warning and signalled their intention to abandon '
            'the landing and to go around and try again. Shortly afterwards, '
            'the aircraft came down on the runway in a belly landing, touching '
            'down about 1,200 metres (1,310 yards) along the 2,800-metre '
            'runway and sliding into the embankment at the end of the landing '
            'strip. On Monday morning, investigators were trying to identify '
            'some of the more than two dozen remaining victims, as anguished '
            'families waited inside the Muan airport terminal. Cries of '
            'anguish echoed through a lounge at Muan International Airport as '
            'families waited for news of relatives killed in the plane crash. '
            'Grieving families are increasingly desperate — and angry — as '
            'they wait for formal identification of the remains of their loved '
            'ones, hoping to hold funerals and properly mourn. “I apologise '
            'deeply… but the extent of the damage to the bodies is profound,” '
            'an official told families at a briefing on Monday, trying to '
            'explain the immense hurdles facing workers trying to recover '
            'remains while also preserving crash-site evidence. “There are '
            'many cases in which arms and legs have been severed,” he said, '
            'his words causing cries of shock and horror among the waiting '
            'families. Using finger prints and DNA analysis, authorities have '
            'identified 146 of the victims, and are working hard on the 33 '
            'still to be verified. Soldiers were still combing through '
            'wetlands near the airport — apparently looking for body parts — '
            'and an AFP reporter saw blood-stained seats and splatters of '
            'human remains on the ground near the wreckage. Park Han-shin, who '

            'Covid-19 killed millions of people, shredded economies and '
            'crippled health systems. “We   to call on China to share data and '
            'access so we can understand the origins of Covid-19. This is a '
            'moral and scientific imperative,” the WHO said in a statement. '
            '“Without transparency, sharing, and cooperation among countries, '
            'the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future '
            'epidemics and pandemics.” The WHO recounted how on Dec 31, 2019, '
            'its country office in China picked up a media statement from the '
            'health authorities in Wuhan concerning cases of “viral pneumonia” '
            'in the city.      “In the weeks, months and years that unfolded '
            'after that, Covid-19 came to shape our lives and our world,” the '
            'UN health agency said. “As we mark this milestone, let’s take a '
            'moment to honour the lives changed and lost, recognise those who '
            'are suffering from Covid-19 and Long Covid, express gratitude to '
            'the health workers who sacrificed so much to care for us, and '
            'commit to learning from Covid-19 to build a healthier tomorrow.” '
            'Earlier this month, the WHO’s Director General Tedros Adhanom '
            'Ghebreyesus addressed the issue of whether the world was better '
            'prepared for the next pandemic than it was for Covid-19. “The '
            'answer is yes, and no,” he told a press conference. “If the next '
            'pandemic arrived today, the world would still face some of the '
            'same weaknesses and vulnerabilities that gave Covid-19 a foothold '
            'five years ago. “But the world has also learnt many of the '
            'painful lessons the pandemic taught us, and has taken significant '
            'steps to strengthen its defences against future epidemics and '
            'pandemics.”      In December 2021, spooked by the devastation '

            'industry sectors and poorer countries wary of being sidelined '
            'when the next pandemic strikes. While the outstanding issues are '
            'few, they include the heart of the agreement: the obligation to '
            'quickly share emerging pathogens, and then the pandemic-fighting '
            'benefits derived from them such as vaccines. The deadline for the '

            'this is as promising as new year resolutions. Concrete decisions '
            'and dates will have to wait till the PTI displays good behaviour '
            'and is then allowed to emerge from the corner it was banished to. '
            'All this back and forth, important as it sounds, is missing the '

            'be so focused on personalities that little else seems to matter. '
            'So at times the clash is between the military chief and a '
            'politician and at other times it is about political leaders. And '

            'the others. But this diagnosis and its prescription seems to '
            'ignore the real crisis — of the people. In fact, it is important '
            'to emphasise that Imran Khan, in some ways, is the symptom and '
            'not the cause of our political crisis. The crisis is the result '
            'of a stagnating economy, demography and a rapacious elite, which '
            'has turned the populace  , where it now identifies with Khan or '
            'identifies Khan as someone who will change the status quo because '
            'everyone else happens to be in power.      So the question to be '
            'asked is: what will happen to this support and the people’s anger '
            'once Khan too is inside the tent? If the voters can dump Nawaz '
            'Sharif after his change of strategy, why will they not turn their '
            'back on the PTI and Khan? More importantly, how will they then '
            'channel their anger? In the long term, this is of far more '
            'importance than any party or leader. As it is, there is a growing '
            'sense of hopelessness among the people at large. Take a recent '
            'outburst by noted actor Waseem Abbas in a clip that went viral. '
            'Or the comments by celebrated author Mohammed Hanif in a talk '
            'show where he said the real   (tragedy) had already happened as '
            'he described the despondency among young people that he '
            'encountered at educational institutes. This will not be addressed '
            'by neutralising Imran Khan (or uniformed officials going to '
            'higher education institutes for lectures) but might just add to '
            'the existing grievances. For disappointment in another mainstream '
            'political party is not going to mean popular support will turn to '
            'other political parties or the establishment. Instead, it will '
            'opt for more radical, non-parliamentary options. This can mean, '
            'at best, organisations which focus on protest rather than '
            'elections such as the PTM or those which advocate violence '
            'against the state. If those in power want to address the real '
            'crisis they need to look beyond the PTI. The aim should not be to '
            'shut up the opposition, be it Khan or anyone else, but to address '
            'the legitimacy crisis. For without this, the state will have to '
            'continue to resort to violence which is counterproductive '
            'eventually. This was already evident in the crackdown after May '
            '9, which worked for a short while but by last month in D-Chowk '
            'the violence had to be escalated. And to assume this will be the '
            'end would be dangerous — more dangerous than the assumptions in '
            '2016 that Donald Trump was over. Neither will this crisis of '
            'legitimacy end by co-opting the PTI because it will — to repeat — '
            'simply place it among the parties that are to be distrusted '
            'because of their role as a partner of the state; in fact, the '
            'anger against the PTI in KP is evidence of this. It is only when '
            'the legitimacy crisis is over that the country can begin to carry '
            'out economic reform by taking some difficult decisions, which do '
            'far more than simply increase the burden on the people. If the '
            'past decade or so have taught us anything it should be that weak '
            'and/or illegitimate governments cannot carry out reform. They are '
            'far too busy shoring up their weak government by securing their '
            'own interests and those of the people or sectors which prop it '
            'up. This is the main reason neither the PTI nor the PML-N were '
            'able to take any ‘difficult’ decision other than burden the '
            'people. And this will not change in the coming days; the '
            'government will neither take steps to broaden the tax base nor '
            'will it be in a position to reduce expenses. Instead, it will '
            'continue to favour special interests such as real estate, the '
            'traders, and journalists and give increments to the bureaucracy '
            'and judiciary, the support of which is needed to suppress '
            'dissent. At the same time, this will require those in power to '

            'to remain in power. North Korea expectedly is in the heart of the '
            'bleak scenario. To the discussants, it seemed the annihilation '
            'was set for 2024. The idea was to provoke Putin before Trump took '
            'over. But we survived it. Or have we? The fear spurred me to '
            'reach for Annie Jacobsen’s chilling and acclaimed new book '
            'tersely called Nuclear War: a Scenario. It probes the prospects '
            'of nuclear exchange and the prohibitive consequences it entails '
            'for human beings. In her scenario, the disarray at the hub of '
            'decision-making was telling, with literally six minutes for the '
            'US president to respond to an assumed North Korean nuclear '
            'missile heading towards the US homeland. Based on interviews with '
            'former dramatis personae that handled Doomsday triggers, '
            'Jacobsen’s inputs came from “presidential advisers, cabinet '
            'ministers, nuclear weapons engineers, scientists, soldiers, '
            'airmen, special operators, Secret Service, emergency management '
            'experts, intelligence analysts, civil servants, and others who '
            'have worked in these scenarios over decades”. What happens when '
            'the bomb explodes? If you’re in the vicinity, you’ll not live to '
            'know. The likely chance is you would vaporise in a fraction of a '
            'second. “A 1-megaton thermonuclear weapon detonation begins with '
            'a flash of light and heat so tremendous it is impossible for the '
            'human mind to comprehend,” says Jacobsen. “One hundred and eighty '
            'million degrees Fahrenheit is four or five times hotter than the '
            'temperature that occurs at the centre of the Earth’s sun.” In the '
            'first millisecond after the bomb strikes the Pentagon, according '
            'to the author’s scenario, there is light. The light superheats '
            'the surrounding air to millions of degrees, creating a massive '
            'firestorm that expands at millions of miles per hour. Assuming '
            'the North Korean missile hits the Pentagon, “everything inside '
            'its 6.5 million square feet of office space explodes into '
            'superheated dust from the initial flash of light and heat, all '
            'the walls shattering with the near-simultaneous arrival of the '
            'shockwave, all 27,000 employees perishing instantly.” It’s '

 'content': 'President Xi Jinping said China will put in place “more '
            'proactive” macroeconomic policies next year, state media '
            'reported, as he addressed a top political advisory body on '
            'Tuesday. The country has struggled this year to climb out of a   '
            'fuelled by a   crisis, weak   and soaring government debt. '
            'Beijing has unveiled a string of   in recent months aimed at  , '
            'including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on home '
            'buying and easing the debt burden on local governments. But '
            'economists have warned that more direct fiscal stimulus aimed at '
            'shoring up domestic consumption is needed to restore full health '
            'in China’s economy.      “We must… further comprehensively deepen '
            'reform, expand high-level opening up, better coordinate '
            'development and security, (and) implement more proactive and '
            'effective macroeconomic policies,” state broadcaster   quoted Xi '
            'as telling the National Committee of the Chinese People’s '
            'Political Consultative Conference at a New Year’s tea party. '
            'Beijing is aiming for an official national growth target this '
            'year of about five per cent, a goal officials have expressed '
            'confidence in achieving but which many economists believe it will '
            'narrowly miss. “The new quality productivity develops steadily, '
            'and annual GDP is expected to grow by about five pc,” Xi '
            'reiterated on Tuesday. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) '
            'expects China’s economy to grow by 4.8pc this year and 4.5pc next '
            'year. Xi’s comments came as Chinese authorities released '
            'optimistic factory activity figures, a sign that recent stimulus '
            'measures may be starting to take effect. China’s Purchasing '
            'Managers’ Index (PMI) — a key measure of industrial output — was '
            '50.1 in December, marking a third consecutive month of expansion, '
            'the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. The figure was '
            'lower than Bloomberg analysts’ prediction of 50.2, but still '
            'above 50, which indicates an expansion in manufacturing '
            'activity.\n'
            'A reading below that shows a contraction. The key indicator slid '
            'for six months in the middle of the year before returning to '
            'expansion territory in October. The non-manufacturing PMI, which '
            'measures activity in the service sector, came in at 52.2 in '
            'December, up from 50.0 in November. “The official PMIs suggest '
            'that the economy gained momentum in December, driven by faster '
            'growth in the services and construction sectors,” Gabriel Ng of '
            'Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. “Increased '
            'policy support towards the end of the year has clearly provided a '
            'near-term boost to growth,” Ng wrote. Ng noted that export orders '
            'in particular rose to a four-month high in December, “probably '
            'helped by US importers ramping up orders in advance of potential '
            'Trump tariffs”.',

            'Commander or Officer of the Order of the British Empire (MBE, CBE '

            'most high-profile Asian-origin politicians, was honoured for '
            'political and public service. A member of Britain’s governing '
            'Labour Party, Sadiq was this year elected mayor for the third '
            'time, although he has faced criticism for crime levels and a '

            'television icon and writer Fry, 67, and former England football '
            'manager Gareth Southgate in being knighted in the latest list. '
            'Fry, best known for playing his idol Oscar Wilde in the 1997 '

            'services to mental health awareness, the environment and charity. '
            'Fry, who has a form of bipolar disorder, has spoken openly about '

            'that he felt “startled and enchanted” after receiving the letter '

            'two straight European Championship finals before stepping down as '
            'the national side’s manager in July. The New Year honours, which '
            'have been awarded since at least 1890, aim to recognise not just '
            'well-known figures but people who have contributed to national '

            'celebrates more of these unsung heroes, and I thank them for '
            'their incredible contribution,” he added. MI5’s Ken McCallum, who '
            'has served as the domestic intelligence service’s director '
            'general since 2020, was also set to receive a knighthood. Among '
            'business executives, ex-Rolls-Royce boss Warren East and former '
            'HSBC chief executive Noel Quinn will be knighted, while Ruth '
            'Cairnie, chair of defence group Babcock, receives a damehood. '
