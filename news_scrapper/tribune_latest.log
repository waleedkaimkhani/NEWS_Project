 'content': 'Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have officially finalized their '
            'divorce, concluding an eight-year legal battle that began in 2016 '
            'when Jolie filed for separation. According to People Magazine, '
            'the divorce settlement was signed on December 30, 2024, closing a '
            'turbulent chapter for the former couple, who were married for '
            'just two years but shared a decade-long relationship. The '
            'settlement resolves their divorce but leaves unresolved disputes '
            'over the French winery Chateau Miraval, which has been a source '
            'of contention. Jolie’s lawyer, James Simon, described her as '
            '“relieved” yet “exhausted” by the prolonged legal process. He '
            'noted that Jolie has focused on finding peace and healing for her '
            'family, having left all shared properties with Pitt. '
            'Transitioning from the legal battle, Pitt appears ready to move '
            'forward with his life. According to Daily Mail, he plans to marry '
            'Los Angeles-based jewelry designer Ines de Ramon in 2025. Sources '
            'close to Pitt stated that finalizing the divorce clears the path '
            'for his future plans, including efforts to mend relationships '
            'with his six children. However, three of his children have '
            'already dropped "Pitt" from their names since the couple’s split, '
            'highlighting the challenges he faces in rebuilding familial ties. '
            'De Ramon, who began dating Pitt in November 2022, is reportedly '
            'eager to expand their family. Sources suggest she urged Pitt to '
            'expedite the divorce process to focus on their future together. '
            'This highly publicized divorce underscores the difficulties of '
            'navigating personal and legal struggles under the spotlight. Both '
            'Pitt and Jolie now look to move forward separately, with Jolie '
            'focusing on family healing and Pitt pursuing new beginnings',

            '“On Dec. 30 and 31, US Navy ships and aircraft targeted a Houthi '
            'command and control facility and advanced conventional weapon '
            '(ACW) production and storage facilities that included missiles '
            'and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV),” the US military’s Central '
            'Command said in a post on X. The attacks began Monday and were '

            'Huthi-controlled coastal regions of Yemen, the US Central Command '
            '(CENTCOM) said. It also said US Navy and Air Force aircraft had '
            'destroyed "seven cruise missiles and one-way attack UAVs over the '

            'naval blockade on Israel, saying they are acting in solidarity '
            'with Palestinians in Israel’s year-long war in Gaza. The Huthis '
