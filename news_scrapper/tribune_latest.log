{'author': 'Dawn.com',
 'category': None,
 'content': 'Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally unveiled the National '
            'Eco\xadnomic Transforma\xadtion Plan 2024-29 on Tuesday called '
            '“Uraan Pakistan: Homegrown National Economic Plan”. The five-year '
            'plan aims to address key economic challenges thro\xadugh a '
            'targeted framework called the “Five Es” — Exports; '
            'E-Pakis\xadtan; Equity and Empo\xadwerment; Environment, Food and '
            'Water Security; and Energy and Infrastructure. Earlier in April, '
            'PM Shehbaz had called for the creation of a comprehensive '
            'five-year strategy to double the country’s exports and '
            'underscored the importance of a collaborative approach, asking '
            'the Min\xadis\xadtry of Trade to devise the exports strategy in '
            'consultation with successful entrepreneurs and stakeholders. The '
            'ceremony to announce the plan was held in Islamabad and addressed '
            'by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Planning Minister Ahsan '
            'Iqbal and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. Addressing the event, '
            'PM Shehbaz said commended the presentations by the aforementioned '
            'ministers. “The crux is that in the last nine months we '
            'negotiated huge challenges [and] difficulties and through '
            'untiring efforts of the federal and provincial governments and '
            'our partners in prosperity and progress, we have been able to '
            'achieve macroeconomic stability. “But this is just the beginning '
            'of a long journey which would entail sacrifice, blood and sweat '
            'to achieve economic growth and finding our lost place among '
            'nations,” he added. The premier said the above required everyone '
            'coming together to work together and march forward with “unity of '
            'thought and action”.      The prime minister explained the '
            'challenges his government faced on the economic front when it '
            'came into power and said the country was forced to go for another '
            'programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He said it '
            'was a moment to ponder why the country had to resort to another '
            'IMF bailout, pointing out to losses of state-owned enterprises, '
            'the circular deficit and corruption. Outlining how growth would '
            'be achieved for the economy, the prime minister said that inputs '
            'would have to be made cheaper, investment would have to be '
            'encouraged and import curbs would have to be removed to encourage '
            'competition, efficiency and export-led growth. “Export-led growth '
            'is the ultimate saviour of Pakistan. You need to earn dollars '
            'that is only possible through exports,” he said, adding that the '
            'same was the central pivot for the new reform package as well. '
            'The prime minister also stressed the need to promote and expand '
            'the digital and technology sectors, particularly the use and '
            'adoption of artificial intelligence. PM Shehbaz also said there '
            'was a need to create political harmony to forward privatisation '
            'efforts to prevent losses and inefficiency in state-owned '
            'enterprises, pointing towards to unsuccessful efforts to '
            'privatise the national carrier. “We faced a setback in PIA’s '
            'privatisation. Facts should be accepted. There is no doubt our '
            'team made full efforts and we are doing so again,” he said. The '
            'premier said the government would have to aim for an annual '
            'investment target of $10 billion, adding that this was “easier '
            'said than done”. He said foreign investment was only possible '
            'through facilitating local investment first, adding that measures '
            'were being taken in this regard. Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq '
            'Dar said “petty politics has to be buried” if Pakistan was to '
            'achieve progress. “If you remember we talked about a charter of '
            'economy multiple times between 2013-2017 but it fell on deaf '
            'ears,” Dar said while addressing the ceremony. He said Pakistan '
            'had to face huge losses and “Pakistan fell from the 24th to the '
            '47th largest economy”. Dar said that he believed Pakistan could '
            'still join the G-20 club of nations, adding that the “goal is '
            'very conveniently achievable provided we remain on track.” He '
            'added that ownership had to be taken by everyone for the economic '
            'road map. Meanwhile, the finance minister recapped “the '
            'significant macroeconomic progress made” in the last 12-14 '
            'months. “We have to move towards growth, but it has to be '
            'sustainable growth, we cannot continue to be in boom and bust '
            'cycles,” he said. “Because we’ve been an import-based economy, as '
            'soon as we go above four per cent, we get into a balance of '
            'payment problems, then we run back to the institution and say: '
            '‘this will be the last fund programme’. “We need to move towards '
            'growth, under the leadership of PM Shehbaz, but on the back of '
            'fundamental reforms which have remained elusive for us and are '
            'imperative for sustained growth.” He said that the journey '
            'towards long-term prosperity warranted homegrown solutions, which '
            'is why PM Shehbaz established the Homegrown Reform Economic '
            'Committee back in May. “That committee extensively reviewed '
            'national economic plans, including the 13th five-year plan '
            'prepared by the Ministry of Planning and duly approved by '
            'National Economic Council and the economic manifestos of various '
            'political parties.” Aurangzeb explained the three main pillars of '
            'the plan: stimulating private investment, which was key to '
            'getting more jobs, higher incomes and a low cost of living '
            'through a more competitive economy. He emphasised that '
            'implementation of the measures was key to the plan, not just '
            'planning. He noted that under Manmohan Singh as premier, India '
            'progressed but Pakistan had not in the comparable timeframe. The '
            'finance minister said the second pillar was stimulating exports, '
            'a key mechanism to drive productivity growth, and the third was '
            'optimising public finances, which was central for stability and '
            'sustained growth. “There is going to be a separate tax policy '
            'unit which is in the process of being created, which will '
            'independently report to the Ministry of Finance. So we’re '
            'separating policy from collection. “This tax policy unit will be '
            'managed by people of the private and public sector so that we can '
            'implement policy continuity . Tax leakages will be plugged '
            'through the use of data analytics, and the privatisation process '
            'will be accelerated.” Explaining the deliverables of the plan, he '
            'said they were achieving a sustainable GDP growth of 6pc by 2028, '
            'creating one million additional jobs annually, securing '
            'additional $10bn private investment per year and hitting an '
            'export target of $60bn by FY2028. Aurangzeb emphasised that there '
            'was “no dearth of policy prescriptions in Pakistan; we have known '
            'the what and why for the longest time, we just don’t do it. This '
            'time round the plan is accompanied by a comprehensive '
            'implementation mechanism.” Earlier today, Information Minister '
            'Attaullah Tarar said the reforms package would significantly '
            'improve citizens’ lives, stimulate growth and strengthen the '
            'economy. Tarar said that the economy had moved from the verge of '
            'default to stability and was now on the path to progress, '
            'highlighting improvements in all economic indicators. He '
            'described the reform-driven plan as being focused on a “Made in '
            'Pakistan” approach and stressed its vital role in fostering '
            'economic growth and bringing positive change to the people of '
            'Pakistan. Tarar said the economic reform agenda was designed to '
            'accelerate the country’s development and ensure the prosperity of '
            'its citizens.',

 'content': 'Actors Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce '
            'settlement, her lawyer told Reuters on Tuesday, bringing an end '
            'to one of Hollywood’s most contentious and closely followed '
            'celebrity splits. Jolie filed for a divorce from Pitt, her '
            'husband of two years and romantic partner since 2005, eight years '
            'ago. The relationship between two of Hollywood’s most well-known '
            'actors had provided steady fodder for the tabloid media for '
            'years. “This is just one part of a long ongoing process that '
            'started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she '
            'is relieved this one part is over,” Jolie’s lawyer James Simon '
            'said in a statement, adding that a divorce settlement has been '
            'finalised, signed and filed with the court. No details of the '
            'settlement were immediately revealed. Pitt’s representatives did '
            'not immediately respond to a   request for comment outside of '
            'regular business hours. Oscar-winning actor Jolie cited '
            'irreconcilable differences in the divorce filing. She '
            'subsequently sought full physical custody of their six children, '
            'then aged eight to 15 with visitation rights for Pitt. The filing '
            'triggered a bitter custody dispute, during which Pitt was '
            'investigated and cleared of child abuse. Both sides accused each '
            'other of trying to manipulate media coverage in their favour. The '
            'couple initially reached a custody decision through a private '
            'judge, granting equal custody of their children. “She doesn’t '
            'speak ill of him publicly or privately. She’s been trying hard to '
            'be light after a dark time,” a source close to the actress was '
            'cited as saying in the lawyer’s statement. The kids had wanted '
            'her to “speak up for herself, to defend herself over these '
            'years,” the source added. Jolie, who won a best-supporting '
            'actress Oscar for   in 2000, was previously married to actors '
            'Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton. Pitt was married to '
            'actor Jennifer Aniston in 2003 when he and Jolie filmed  , the '
            'story of assassins unknowingly assigned to kill each other. There '
            'were reports of an affair, but Jolie told   they were only “very, '
            'very good friends” until Pitt and Aniston split in 2005.',

            'governing Taliban authorities must reverse their ban on Afghan '
            'women working for NGOs. Since the Taliban’s return to power in '
            'August 2021, women have been progressively   from public spaces, '
            'prompting the United Nations to denounce the “ ” the '
            'administration has established. “I am deeply alarmed at the '
            'recent announcement by the de facto authorities in Afghanistan '
            'that non-governmental organisations’ licenses will be revoked if '
            'they continue to employ Afghan women. This is absolutely the '
            'wrong path being taken,” Turk said in a statement. He said that '
            'in a letter dated Thursday, the Taliban’s economy ministry '
            'ordered national and international NGOs to comply with a decree '
            'issued two years ago that bars them from employing Afghan women. '
            '“The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan remains dire, with '
            'more than half the population living in poverty. NGOs play a '
            'vital role in providing critical life-saving assistance — to '
            'Afghan women, men, girls and boys — and this measure will '
            'directly impact the ability of the population to receive '
            'humanitarian aid,” said Turk. “I once again urge the de facto '
            'authorities in Afghanistan to revoke this deeply discriminatory '
            'decree and all other measures which seek to eradicate women and '
            'girls’ access to education, work and public services, including '
            'healthcare, and that restrict their freedom of movement. “No '
            'country can progress — politically, economically or socially — '
            'while excluding half of its population from public life. “For the '
            'future of Afghanistan, the de facto authorities must change '
            'course.” Taliban authorities have   post-primary education for '
            'girls and women, restricted employment and blocked access to '
            'parks and other public places. A recent law   women from singing '
            'or reciting poetry in public under the Taliban government’s '
            'ultra-strict application of Islamic law. It also encourages them '
            'to “veil” their voices and bodies outside the home. Some local '
            'radio and television stations have also stopped broadcasting '
            'female voices. The Taliban administration claims that Islamic law '
            '“guarantees” the rights of Afghan men and women.',

            'back and wonder how all of that fit into just 365 days. We had '
            'elections aplenty, drama galore, dupattas being fixed without '
            'consent and a number of stories about cricketers —\xa0with some '
            'behaving badly. From outrageously opulent weddings to a certain '
            'not-so-beloved writer’s unimaginative explanation for meeting a '
            'woman at 4am, our top stories this year were an interesting '
            'mix.      One of the most talked about topics online in 2024 was '
            'the Ambani wedding —\xa0how much did it cost, who attended, what '
            'they wore and, most importantly, who was performing. Well, you '
            'couldn’t get much bigger than Rihanna, the Barbadian superstar '
            'who hasn’t been performing for her fans much in the last few '
            'years. The Ambani clan pulled the singer out of her '
            'semi-retirement// and onto a stage in Jamnagar to perform her '
            'greatest hits in a terrible outfit replete with ripped underarm '
            'seams as part of their pre-wedding festivities. That this story '
            'is our 10th most read this year encapsulates the strange '
            'fascination we all had with this over-the-top wedding and '
            'everything associated with it.      You can read the story  '
            '.      You can imagine our surprise when Haris Rauf was involved '
            'in a physical altercation with a couple of cricket fans — they '
            'weren’t his fans, clearly. The bowler  was up in arms after a '
            '‘fan’ made a very inappropriate remark about Rauf’s mother. Rauf '
            'immediately began moving towards the man and was pulled back by '
            'his wife and later blocked by other men who ask him to let it go. '
            'He later posted a statement —\xa0not an apology\xa0— and said he '
            'would “not hesitate to respond accordingly” when his family is '
            'being criticised by fans.      You can read the story  .      If '
            'ever there was a polarising story, this would be it. Maryam Nawaz '
            'fixed a police officer’s dupatta without asking and the the '
            'internet went wild. It’s unsurprising that this story landed in '
            'our top 10, because it was the talk of the town (and the office). '
            'Is it appropriate to touch someone’s dupatta, that too on camera? '
            'The debate stirred from this act was intense —\xa0too intense, '
            'we’d say —\xa0and people seemed to believe that those who '
            'criticised the Punjab chief minister were on the side of '
            'immodesty rather than opposed to a woman being touched without '
            'her consent.      You can read the full story  .      Is it '
            'really a top 10 list without a story about India? In this case, '
            'it was a story about Indian film   which was in line with the '
            'many patriotic Bollywood films that seem to exist solely to '
            'highlight how sneaky and evil Pakistanis are. You’d think they’d '
            'find a new villain to star in their movies. X (formerly Twitter) '
            'was quite fed up with it too, with many users wondering when the '
            'blatant propaganda would end. Indian audiences themselves seemed '
            'to be quite over Bollywood’s fixation with the “evil” '
            'Pakistan.      You can read the story  .      Sometimes, life '
            'mimics art. And sometimes, artists who write terrible stories '
            'demonising women and say awful things about them fall prey to the '
            'oldest trick in the book — honey traps. Khalilur Rehman Qamar is '
            'known for both the dramas he writes and the drama he causes when '
            'he says inane things, mostly about women. This past summer, he '
            'was involved in drama of another kind when he was allegedly '
            'kidnapped and held for ransom. According to the FIR, Qamar '
            'received a phone call from an unknown number close to midnight. '
            'The caller, who identified herself as Amna Urooj, claimed to be a '
            'fan and expressed a desire to collaborate with him on a TV drama. '
            'The writer went to meet her at 4:40am, as one does, where he was '
            'soon accosted by seven armed men who robbed him and held him for '
            'ransom. “I am sick and my doctor has strictly told me to not go '
            'out in the daytime for five years,” he said at a press conference '
            'following the incident. “Even if he hadn’t said that, we meet '
            'people at night and you don’t differentiate between men and '
            'women. When there’s no objection to me meeting men at night, then '
            'why should there be an objection to me agreeing to see this woman '
            'at the break of dawn? Because this happened at 4:40am, I had not '
            'agreed to go at night when I got the call. For the past 15 days, '
            'she was pestering me to see her.” Ironically, following the '
            'incident, a 2019 interview of Qamar resurfaced in which he '
            'mockingly said that if women want equality, they should consider '
            'kidnapping a man — him.      You can read the story  .       '
            'released on YouTube to much fanfare. It starred Fawad Khan and '
            'Sanam Saeed after all, albeit as siblings, and fans were on '
            'tenterhooks, excited to watch the show and see what kind of '
            'fantastical world Asim Abbasi had created. Unfortunately, the '
            'cinematography and story were overshadowed by public discontent '
            'over what many considered ‘provocative’ themes in the show. In '
            'light of the backlash,   decided to remove the show from '
            'Pakistani YouTube. Abbasi, upon receiving hate for the show, had '
            'previously said, “With all due respect, if you find '
            'queer/non-heteronormative storylines ‘distasteful,’ please do not '
            'watch my content. I will always champion the rights of all and '
            'tell stories that we believe in.”      You can read the story  '
            '.      This story was a fever dream, because it had so many '
            'comedic elements. Shahid Afridi stumbled on a pro-Israel '
            'demonstration, apparently didn’t read any of their signs, and '
            'agreed to take a selfie with them as they held pro-Israel '
            'pamphlets, according to him. According to them, he spoke to them '
            'of his “own free will” and posed for a selfie with hostage '
            'leaflets to “support our cause”. The two groups began beefing on '
            'X,  with everyone looking on wide-eyed, because who in the world '
            'would expect Shahid Afridi to get into a social media battle with '
            'a zionist group?      You can read the story       This story '
            'came a day after cricketer Shoaib Malik announced his third '
            'marriage. People were shocked and making all kinds of '
            'assumptions. Sania Mirza, the Indian tennis player who married '
            'Malik in 2010 and shares a son with him, took to social media — '
            'through her father — to clear the air and announce that she and '
            'Malik had been divorced for a few months. This was the first time '
            'Mirza addressed rumours of her divorce, which were rife long '
            'before the announcement. She did, however, post several cryptic '
            'messages on Instagram about marriage that had gossipmongers '
            'aflutter.      You can read the story       No one has ever '
            'accused Pakistanis of not being dramatic. We’re dramatic as can '
            'be and when it comes to cricket, it’s even worse. Naturally, '
            'Pakistan’s loss to India in the T20 World Cup was a bitter pill '
            'to swallow. What made it worse was that we lost by the narrowest '
            'of margins —\xa0a mere six runs. While there were a lot of jokes, '
            'beneath the banter and the tweets lay a deep-seated '
            'disappointment in Pakistani cricket.      You can read the story  '
            '.      And our top story for this year was none other than Shoaib '
            'Malik announcing his marriage to Sana Javed after rumours of his '
            'separation from Sania Mirza reached a fever pitch. It isn’t '
            'surprising that this was our top story —\xa0Pakistanis love '
            'weddings, after all, and second (or in this case third) marriages '
            'are always a source of fascination. This was Javed’s second '
            'marriage and Malik’s third and for most people, the news of their '

            'five years in prison. The two employees accused of supplying '
            'drugs face between four and 15 years in jail. The judge has '
            'ordered the two men accused of supplying the drugs be remanded '

            '2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about '
            'family dignity and shame. As the year draws to a close, the '
            'pattern persists, with women across the country falling victim to '
            'violence. These cases are not mere statistics — they represent '
            'the harsh reality faced by countless women, where personal '
            'autonomy and dignity are violently stripped away under the guise '
            'of preserving family ‘honour’. In   this year, a man murdered '
            'four women in his family, including his mother, in a fit of rage '
            'over their TikTok videos. He told the police the videos spread '
            '“immodesty and shamelessness, tarnishing the family’s '
            'reputation”. In  , Amina Bibi, a mother of three, was shot dead '
            'by her brother, Zafar Hussain, in the Qasimpur area of Pakpattan. '
            'Hussain told the police he thought his sister had a “questionable '
            'character”. In  , a mother of five was brutally killed in '
            'Faisalabad by her husband and younger brother, allegedly to '
            'protect the family’s ‘honour’. Accused of having an affair, the '
            'victim was attacked at home with bricks, leading to fatal '
            'injuries. Her body was later dumped in a nullah through a donkey '
            'cart. In  , Saira, 19, and her husband lost their lives in an '
            'alleged ‘honour’ killing incident in Karachi’s Orangi Town. The '
            'suspect, Saira’s brother, was arrested for allegedly shooting the '
            'couple, who had married a month earlier against the family’s '
            'wishes. In  , 20-year-old Shaheena Bibi was killed by her father '
            'and brother in the name of ‘honour’ in Fazilwala, Lodhran. '
            'Shaheena had previously eloped with the man she loved but was '
            'brought back home, only to be murdered. In  , Mohabbat Khan '
            'allegedly murdered his wife, Shahnaz (45), and daughter, Samia '
            '(18), in Lahore’s Alfalah Town to preserve his so-called honour, '
            'The suspect attacked the two women with a dagger, leaving them '
            'dead on the spot. Other similar incidents throughout the year '
            'continued to illustrate the brutal continuation of ‘honour’ '
            'killings under various justifications. Data from the Human Rights '
            'Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ '
            'killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with '
            'particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to '
            'November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in '
            'the country. The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in '
            'murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.      In 2023, the '
            'country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking '
            'place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to '
            '‘honour’ killings. ‘Honour’ killings refer to the murder of '
            'individuals, predominantly women and girls, by family members who '
            'believe the victim has brought dishonour upon the family. Per  , '
            'the practice is rampant in patriarchal societies, particularly in '
            'Pakistan, India, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) '
            'region, where male family members are tasked with maintaining the '
            'honour of the family, often at the expense of the woman’s  '
            'According to the  , victims of ‘honour’ killings are typically '
            'accused of committing “immoral” acts, ranging from conversing '
            'with unrelated men to engaging in premarital physical relations, '
            'even if they are victims of rape or assault.      However, news '
            'reports show that a woman may also be targeted for rejecting an '
            'arranged marriage, marrying of her own choice, seeking a divorce, '
            'or attempting to separate from an abusive partner. Even the mere '
            'suspicion of behaviour that could tarnish the family’s reputation '
            'can lead to violence, with these judgments often based on '
            'subjective perceptions rather than facts. Paradoxically, female '
            'relatives sometimes defend or even assist in carrying out these '
            'killings. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)   that up to '
            '5,000 women are killed each year in the name of ‘honour’. '
            'Experts, however,   that many ‘honour’ killings are not reported '
            'at all or are classified as suicides or accidents. Tahira '
            'Abdullah, a human rights defender, highlighted several societal '
            'factors that drive the increase in Gender-Based Violence (GBV), '
            'including ‘honour’ killings. She pointed to patriarchy, sexism, '
            'rising misogyny, and toxic masculinity as key drivers, '
            'highlighting the persistence of archaic notions of '
            '“honour/dishonour,” with men’s honour often seen as residing in '
            'women’s bodies, contributed to the rise in crimes. Women continue '
            'to be perceived as property or chattel owned by men, and '
            'daughters are considered an economic and socio-cultural burden, '
            'she said, while also attributing the rise in violence to the '
            'influences of feudalism and tribalism, as well as factors such as '
            'poverty, ignorance, and illiteracy.      “The gender-biased '
            'education system, including biased curricula, textbooks, and '
            'teachers, play a significant role,” she told  , citing the '
            'negative impact of toxic social media that glorifies violence, '
            'contributing to an increasingly brutalised society. “Furthermore, '
            'the disrespectful portrayal of women on entertainment channels, '
            'especially in TV dramas, celebrity interviews, and late-night '
            '‘humour’ shows, coupled with the non-adherence to media ethics '
            'and an agreed code of conduct, all contribute to the growing '
            'problem,” she said. The first law addressing ‘honour’ killings in '
            'Pakistan was introduced in 2004, defining the offence under   of '
            'the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). In 2016, the Criminal Law '
            '(Amendment) (Offences in the Name of Pretext of Honour) Act of '
            '2016, was  , following the brutal murder of  , who fell victim to '
            'an ‘honour’ killing orchestrated by her brother. “The 2016 '
            'amendment was aimed at addressing a crucial issue in such cases: '
            'when an ‘honour’ killing incident takes place, it typically '
            'involves a family matter. After the crime, both parties often '
            'reach a compromise, meaning the father, as the complainant, may '
            'pardon his son, preventing any punishment,” said Muhammad Usman '
            'Warraich, a high court advocate.      Since the offence of murder '
            'under   of the PPC is compoundable — meaning that matters can be '
            'settled or resolved by mutual agreement — perpetrators could '
            'avoid punishment if the complainant forgave them. In response, '
            'the 2016 amendment made a crucial change by introducing  , which '
            'addresses   — a violent act that disrupts societal peace. This '
            'amendment ensured that when an ‘honour’ killing occurs, the state '
            'can intervene if the complainant pardons the offender. “Under '
            'Section 311, the state becomes the complainant, as this provision '
            'is non-compoundable, and the case must proceed to a logical '
            'conclusion. The punishment for ‘honour’ killings, under Sections '
            '311 and 302, includes the death sentence or life imprisonment. '
            'The option for a 25-year sentence under   is not applicable when '
            'Section 311 is invoked,” he explained. Advocate Warraich, '
            'however, emphasised that while the 2016 amendment brought '
            'necessary changes, the original law of 2004 remains foundational. '
            'However, outdated procedural laws, rooted in the colonial '
            'framework of 1860, hinder the effective implementation of '
            'reforms. “These outdated laws require comprehensive reform to '
            'address contemporary issues more effectively,” he added. '
            'Barrister Rida Tahir, advocate high court, also highlighted '
            'significant loopholes in the law, particularly in proving intent. '
            '“In lieu of a confession by the accused or strong evidence '
            'against him/her, it is difficult to prove whether an ‘honour’ '
            'killing was committed or a murder. Moreover, the language of the '
            'law leaves it up to the discretion of the Court to punish the '
            'accused in cases of ‘honour’ killing,” she said. Underreporting '
            'of violence against women (VAW), including ‘honour’ killings and '
            'domestic violence, remains a critical issue in Pakistan. Several '
            'barriers contribute to the problem, including stigma, '
            'male-dominated institutions, and a lack of resources. Barrister '
            'Tahir talked about the challenges women face when interacting '
            'with law enforcement. “Due to socio-cultural discriminatory '
            'attitudes, the female victims of SGBV are stigmatised and often '
            'blamed rather than supported. Due to this, women are often '
            'unreasonably exposed to inequality and prejudice while pursuing '
            'assistance from the police force,” she said.      The '
            'male-dominated police force and the insensitive treatment by '
            'officers often discourage victims from reporting crimes. Efforts '
            'to improve the situation, such as women’s police stations, gender '
            'protection units, and one-stop protection centres, have had some '
            'success. Still, these facilities remain scarce in many areas, '
            'because of which their impact becomes limited, Tahir said.      '
            'Another critical issue is the shortage of female medico-legal '
            'personnel across Pakistan, which prevents many women from '
            'accessing essential services, worsening the problem. “Even though '
            'reporting of the VAW cases has increased in the past few years, '
            'which may seem like the VAW cases have increased, still, many '
            'cases of VAW remain widely unreported,” she said. The lawyer '
            'added that there was a dire need for gender-sensitisation '
            'training for both police and judges, along with increased legal '
            'awareness to help survivors navigate the system effectively. '
            'Imaan Mazari, a human rights lawyer and activist, pointed out '
            'that many victims face immense financial and social pressures, '
            'leaving them with little choice but to remain in abusive '
            'situations. “Many women don’t have family or other support '
            'structures. While the system can, of course, be revamped and '
            'strengthened to streamline legal processes and provide better '
            'support structures for women/survivors, massive awareness '
            'campaigns along with actual empowerment/employment initiatives '
            'need to be prioritised and expanded,” she told  . She said that '
            'doing so would enable women facing violence to have the resources '
            'to leave and fight their legal battles while ensuring their '
            'physical and emotional safety. Nadia Rahman, Amnesty '
            'International’s Deputy Regional Director for research in South '
            'Asia, had talked about another  : the extra-legal power of jirgas '
            'or tribal councils. “The continued failure of the Government of '
            'Pakistan to curb the extra-legal power of jirgas or tribal '
            'councils to run parallel legal systems perpetuating patriarchal '
            'violence with impunity is extremely concerning,” she had said in '
            'a statement issued last year. Rahman further pointed out that the '
            'Supreme Court of Pakistan has ruled that the operation of these '
            'councils is contrary to the country’s international obligations '
            'under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other '
            'international conventions. She added: “While repeated so-called '
            '‘honour killings’ have resulted in legislative amendments and '
            'societal outrage in the country, they remain unabated. It is not '
            'enough to arrest people after such attacks take place. The '
            'authorities must end impunity for violence and abolish so-called '
            'village and tribal councils that prescribe such horrific crimes.” '
            'The persistence of ‘honour’ crimes in Pakistan stems from deeply '
            'entrenched societal attitudes and weak enforcement mechanisms '
            'that embolden perpetrators. Mazari explained that the lack of '
            'certainty in punishment perpetuates a culture of impunity. “Where '
            'there is no certainty of punishment, and in fact impunity for '
            'even the most heinous offences, the existence of laws in itself '
            'doesn’t mean very much. The mindset of offenders and society at '
            'large has not changed,” she noted. Law enforcement practices '
            'often fail to hold perpetrators accountable. Police officers — '
            'frequently the first responders in cases of domestic violence — '
            'sometimes advise victims to resolve matters privately, '
            'reinforcing cycles of impunity, she said. This reluctance to '
            'treat such crimes with the seriousness they demand undermines '
            'efforts to establish a culture of justice. In cases of domestic '
            'violence, police officers — often the first responders — are '
            'sometimes inclined to advise victims to resolve matters '
            'privately, reinforcing the cycle of impunity, she said.      Syed '
            'Miqdad Mehdi, a legal expert and human rights activist, also '
            'pointed out the systemic flaws that allow offenders to evade '
            'accountability — such as weak investigations, ineffective '
            'prosecutions, and hostile witnesses — which collectively create '
            'significant barriers to justice. “The role of family dynamics '
            'further complicates cases, as relatives often seek to settle '
            'matters outside the court, undermining the legal process,” he '
            'said.      He called for systemic reforms to ensure '
            'accountability, including strengthening law enforcement capacity, '
            'addressing procedural loopholes, and improving the prosecution '
            'process. “Ensuring justice and protecting vulnerable women '
            'requires a coordinated effort to uphold the rule of law and '
            'ensure accountability.” Without meaningful action to address '
            'these societal and institutional failures, honour crimes are '
            'likely to persist, leaving survivors without recourse and '
            'emboldening offenders to act without fear of consequences.',

            'juncture — grappling with a year shaped by political turmoil, '
            'devastating floods, spiralling violence, and the rise of '
            'grassroots rights movements. The year began ominously enough — '
            'with a direct confrontation in Islamabad   demanding to know the '
            'whereabouts of missing persons as well as   culminating in an '
            'exchange of missiles in January. This was followed by a series of '
            'terror incidents, including suicide bombings, ambushes targeting '
            'security forces, and coordinated attacks across the province. '
            'According to a   296 people, including civilians and military '
            'personnel, were killed, and over 500 injured in 563 reported '

            'coinciding with general elections, and August, marking the '

            'attempt to explore the factors fuelling unrest and how the '
            'situation may unfold in the coming year. The start of 2024 saw an '
            'alarming   as both countries engaged in a rare exchange of '
            'missile strikes. On January 16, Iran targeted Pakistan’s Panjgur '
            'district, claiming to have struck two strongholds of the '
            'anti-Iran militant group, Jaish al-Adl. This Sunni Baloch '
            'militant group has long been accused by Tehran of orchestrating '
            'unrest and ambushes in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province — a '
            'region with a restive Sunni Baloch population that alleges '

            'launched one of its most sophisticated and deadly offensives in '
            'Balochistan’s Mach town. The   targeted security installations in '
            'the city of Mach, firing at least 15 rockets from nearby '
            'mountains, before attacking a security forces’ camp near the '
            'central jail and also entering the Mach railway station. This was '
            'a turning point for the BLA, showcasing its evolution from a '
            'small guerrilla force into a highly lethal terror outfit, capable '
            'of executing complex operations. The Mach attack not only '
            'highlighted the growing operational capacity of Baloch insurgents '
            'but also showed the deepening instability in a region plagued by '
            'overlapping militant movements and cross-border tensions. As the '
            'year progressed, these events showed the fragile and combustible '
            'nature of relations between Iran and Pakistan, with militant '
            'groups exploiting the vacuum of security on both sides of the '
            'border. The year ahead may see both nations struggling  to manage '
            'these volatile dynamics while addressing their domestic '
            'insurgencies. In late January,   by Baloch activists, led by Dr '
            'Mahrang Baloch,  , with activists expressing “disappointment with '
            'the state”. The sit-in, which began in December 2023 amid '
            'freezing weather, ended with the protesters facing harassment, '
            'police cases and a sustained media campaign against them. '
            'Caretaker Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar repeatedly   of '
            'missing persons of being “terrorist sympathisers”, further '
            'deepening tensions and aggravating the long-standing distrust '
            'between Islamabad and Balochistan. For decades, Balochistan has '
            'accused Islamabad of neglecting its grievances, with the '
            'treatment of the protesters in Islamabad underlining what many '
            'see as heavy-handed tactics. Reports of harassment of Dr Mahrang '
            'and her fellow activists drew sharp criticism and anger in '
            'Balochistan. Although the NPC briefly   — a decision reversed '
            'following public backlash — the damage had already been done. Dr '
            'Mahrang’s decision to call off the protest disheartened many '
            'young people in Balochistan, who perceived it as yet another '
            'instance of systemic disregard for their concerns.      Dr '
            'Mahrang’s return to Quetta told a different story.   to greet '
            'her, with supporters honouring her with pearls and the Balochi '
            'turban, a traditional emblem of immense respect. Musicians and '
            'poets dedicated songs to her, and some dubbed her “The Sardar of '
            'the Baloch” — a title traditionally reserved for male tribal '
            'leaders. Ironically, the state’s heavy-handed approach in '
            'Islamabad had elevated her standing, turning her into a fiery '
            'young leader who people believed was not afraid of challenging '
            'the powerful. February saw Balochistan go to polls under the '
            'shadow of   The home department described February as one of the '
            'most volatile months in Balochistan, second only to August. On '
            'the eve of the general elections,   claimed the lives of more '
            'than 30 people and injured dozens. Meanwhile, the Baloch Raaji '
            'Ajoi Sangar (BRAS), an umbrella organisation of Baloch separatist '
            'insurgents, issued a post-election statement claiming '
            'responsibility for 161 terror attacks on polling stations across '
            'the province. Overall, the elections were widely regarded as '
            'controversial, with Baloch and Pashtun nationalist parties '
            'labelling the process as flawed. Following the results, the '
            'Balochistan National Party (BNP Mengal), National Party (NP), '
            'Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), and Hazara Democratic '
            'Party (HDP)   to protest the alleged rigging. Against the '
            'backdrop of violence, frustration among the youth, and growing '
            'alienation, the elections were a critical opportunity to defuse '
            'tensions between Islamabad and Balochistan. However,   and the '
            'alleged imposition of what nationalist parties described as '
            '“artificial leadership” deepened mistrust and further alienated '
            'the province. A credible and impartial government could have '
            'helped ease tensions, particularly by engaging with the BYC, '
            'which emerged as a vital political force in 2024, comprising '
            'activists from various political parties and civil society. '
            'Instead, the government’s decision to sideline the BYC and frame '
            'its leadership in police cases disillusioned Baloch youth, '
            'intensifying feelings of hopelessness and anger in a province '
            'already plagued by violence and disillusion from the centre. With '
            'the province already reeling from political instability and '
            'escalating violence, it was also severely affected by natural '
            'disasters that compounded its existing challenges. In late '
            'February and early March,   the Gwadar, Makran, and northern and '
            'central regions of the province, causing widespread disruption to '
            'daily life and halting traffic across affected areas.      The '
            '30-hour downpour triggered flash floods that submerged large '
            'swaths of land, overwhelming the already fragile infrastructure. '
            'The district administration in Gwadar was forced to declare a '
            'state of emergency as the rains inundated homes, roads, and '
            'agricultural fields, further deepening the province’s crisis. The '
            'situation was exacerbated by poor infrastructure, insufficient '
            'urban planning, and the blocking of natural water pathways due to '
            'unregulated construction on traditional riverbeds. These factors '
            'worsened the already dire conditions, making it clear that '
            'Balochistan’s lack of preparedness for such calamities had been a '
            'long-standing issue. The year 2024 also witnessed a dramatic '
            'escalation in both the intensity and strategy of terror outfits '
            'operating in the province, particularly the BLA. Once known for '
            'its hit-and-run tactics, the BLA has,   employed suicide bombings '
            'on and off as part of its operational repertoire. However, where '
            'the group previously managed only one or two such attacks '
            'annually, 2024 saw a dramatic surge with six claimed suicide '
            'attacks. This shift speaks of a broader evolution of the terror '
            'outfit from rural guerrilla warfare to urban-targeted militancy. '
            'The group’s focus has shifted toward striking strategically '
            'significant urban centres, which highlights a growing operational '
            'sophistication. A notable example came in March, when the BLA   a '
            'linchpin of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and a '
            'symbol of economic and strategic importance. The attack, carried '
            'out in one of the province’s most heavily secured zones, was a '
            'reminder of the grim trajectory of violence in Balochistan and '
            'the increasing capabilities of insurgent groups and terror '
            'outfits. Despite the lingering fallout from the March attack on '
            'the Gwadar Port, the BLA struck again,   in Turbat just days '
            'later. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the attack '
            'was thwarted due to a “swift and effective response by the '
            'troops, ensuring the safety and security of personnel and '
            'assets”. However, the attempted strike highlights several key '
            'issues: the insurgents’ growing ability to exploit security '
            'loopholes and the increasing manpower at their disposal. The '
            'frequency and scale of such attacks also raise concerns about the '
            'rising number of Baloch youth joining armed groups. The '
            'flashpoint of this violence came on August 26, when the BLA '
            'launched a series of   which shocked the authorities and marked '
            'one of the deadliest days in the two-decade-long insurgency. The '
            'assaults included blocking highways, a suicide bombing by a young '
            'woman at a military camp in Lasbela, sabotage of gas pipelines '
            'and railway tracks, and the killing of 23 passengers, mostly '
            'Punjabis. In total, 72 people were killed in these attacks.      '
            'The timing was symbolic, commemorating the anniversary of Nawab '
            'Akbar Khan Bugti’s 2006 death, an event seen as the catalyst for '
            'the current wave of insurgency. The   in areas such as Lasbela '
            'and Musakhail on the border with Punjab — which had previously '
            'been unaffected by the insurgency — along with the involvement of '
            'a young female law student, highlight the BLA’s alarmingly '
            'growing operational capabilities. The BLA’s increasing reliance '
            'on suicide bombings is a scary shift in its tactics, as seen in '
            'Quetta, where a suicide bomber targeted the   killing over two '
            'dozen people, including 16 security personnel, and injuring more '
            'than 100 in November. Similarly, in October, a   near Karachi’s '
            'international airport killed two Chinese nationals and injured 11 '
            'others. Traditionally, Baloch armed groups have avoided attacks '
            'in densely populated public areas such as railway stations and '
            'highways. However, this restraint appears to have diminished, '
            'reflecting a troubling evolution in their strategy. The attacks '
            'also point to the BLA’s ability to recruit and mobilise manpower, '
            'even as the state intensifies its crackdown on insurgent outfits '
            'in the province. According to   44 per cent of the total attacks '
            'in the province targeted armed forces, while a staggering 56pc '
            'were directed at civilians. Among the most vulnerable groups were '
            'settlers from Punjab, who have become a frequent target of '
            'insurgent groups. In the second week of April, the BLA carried '
            'out an   where the terrorists offloaded nine passengers from a '
            'bus, checked their identity cards, and executed them on a '
            'deserted roadside. The victims were all from central Punjab. On '
            'May 9,   in Surbandar in Gwadar. These targeted attacks underline '
            'the persistent insecurity faced by non-local civilians, '
            'particularly those from Punjab, who are increasingly viewed as '
            'symbols of the state’s presence and economic interests in '
            'Balochistan. These attacks in Balochistan are part of a broader '
            'surge in violence that has spilled over into neighbouring Iran. '
            'On April 4, gunmen launched simultaneous attacks on multiple '
            'security and military compounds in the southeastern Iranian towns '
            'of   killing 11 Iranian security personnel. This cross-border '
            'violence signals the growing regional ramifications of the Baloch '
            'insurgency and highlights the increasing volatility across the '
            'Goldsmith Line. Given this scenario, it is imperative that the '
            'state makes every effort to stem this ethnic violence. Allowing '
            'it to simmer will only result in further escalation, as seen in '
            'other areas of the country. As violence escalated and the law '
            'enforcement agencies struggled to contain the insurgency in '
            'Balochistan, one of the most concerning developments has been the '
            'growing clampdown on freedom of speech and the press. For the '
            'first time in decades, police and local authorities   to prevent '
            'members of the BYC from holding a seminar on the situation in '
            'Gwadar. This unprecedented move sent a chilling message about the '
            'extent to which the authorities are willing to go to stifle free '
            'expression. At the same time, however, rights activists gained '
            'international recognition for their advocacy against enforced '
            'disappearances and alleged human rights abuses. In May 2024, '
            'Sammi Deen Baloch became the   of the Front-Line Defenders Human '
            'Rights Award, an honour given to her by the Ireland-based human '
            'rights organisation. Later in October,   among its 100 next '
            'emerging leaders, acknowledging her as a rising voice for change. '
            'The recognition, however, came at great personal cost for Dr '
            'Mahrang. In June, she was   for disrupting government officials '
            'from performing their duty, rioting, condemnation of the creation '
            'of the state, advocacy for the abolition of its sovereignty, and '
            'sedition during an event at the Quetta Press Club in May. The '
            'authorities also placed her on a no-fly list in October,   from '
            'traveling to New York to attend   gala to accept her award. In '
            'December, she was   as one of the 100 most inspiring and '
            'influential women of 2024. In July 2024, the BYC organised the   '
            '(Baloch National Gathering) in the coastal city of Gwadar to '
            'raise awareness about what they termed as the exploitation of '
            'Balochistan’s resources and to highlight alleged human rights '
            'abuses in the region.      The protest, which aimed to draw '
            'attention to these pressing issues, was met with a violent '
            'crackdown by provincial authorities, leading to clashes between '
            'protesters and security forces in Gwadar and Mastung. The unrest '
            'led to the   with several others injured. Despite roadblocks set '
            'up by authorities to prevent the protests, hundreds of protesters '
            'from across the province successfully made their way to Gwadar’s '
            'Marine Drive for the gathering. Earlier, on their way to '
            'Mastung,   by security forces. For more than a week, the city of '
            'Gwadar was effectively shut down. The crackdown on peaceful '
            'protesters   to the people of Balochistan. It reinforced the '
            'growing belief among the youth that their calls for change, even '
            'through peaceful means, would be met with hostility by the state. '
            'This violent response to a nonviolent protest only fuelled the '
            'narrative among Baloch nationalists that the authorities reject '
            'dialogue and peaceful struggle, which further alienated the '
            'province’s already disgruntled youth. But even as the state has '
            'attempted to clamp down on dissent, more and more young men and '
            'women took to social media, leveraging modern communication '
            'technologies to amplify their voices. The vast majority of these '
            'activists, especially women, hail from middle-class backgrounds '
            'and expressed growing disillusionment with traditional '
            'nationalist leaders, accusing them of failing to address their '
            'community’s pressing concerns. One example of this shift is Dr '
            'Shaale Baloch, an emerging new voice in Balochistan’s activism. '
            'With an MBBS degree, Dr Shaale has been mobilising women under '
            'the banner of the Baloch Women Forum, focusing on some of the '
            'most neglected areas such as Awaran and Mand, often overshadowed '
            'by Balochistan’s urban politics. Having grown up in a small '
            'neglected remote village in Kech district during a period of '
            'heightened militancy, Dr Shaale’s activism is deeply personal, '
            'driven by her experiences of repression and neglect. She has a '
            'large number of young followers, especially women from the '
            'peripheries. “Baloch politics and activism have long been centred '
            'in urban areas,” says Dr Shaale. “My mission is to bring the '
            'peripheries into focus.” Activists like Dr Shaale, Dr Mahrang and '
            'Sammi now have the power to rally thousands to protests and '
            'sit-ins within hours, which shows their influence and the '
            'public’s growing trust in women-led movements. “There has been a '
            'huge political vacuum, and masses have been disappointed by '
            'traditional nationalist parties, who have only benefited from '
            'Balochistan’s conflict,” says Sadia Baloch, a young activist from '
            'Quetta. “Movements like the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) and '
            'the Baloch Women Forum, led by young women, are filling that gap. '
            'They are trusted because they are women, they are young, and '
            'majority of them are victims themselves. This places an immense '
            'responsibility on their shoulders.” The rise of women leaders '
            'like Dr Shaale Baloch and Dr Mahrang is a transformative moment '
            'in Balochistan’s political landscape, as a new generation of '
            'educated and middle-class women activists from the peripheries '
            'attempts to reshape the narrative and give a voice to the '
            'region’s most marginalised communities. Thus, the year 2025 in '
            'Balochistan hinges on Islamabad’s engagement with the province’s '
            'young, educated activists. The challenge for the state is that '
            'even as it cracks down on insurgents and focuses on '
            'counter-terrorism measures, it must do so without further '
            'alienating the youth. Providing space for discussions with groups '
            'like the BYC and the Baloch Women Forum, while addressing '
            'deep-rooted grievances, could turn these grassroots movements '
            'into agents of peace. Regional dynamics will also shape the '
            'province’s trajectory. With its porous borders, Balochistan’s '
            'stability is somehow also tied to Pakistan’s relations with '
            'Afghanistan and Iran, both of which can influence cross-border '
            'militancy and insurgent networks. Furthermore, the economic '
            'ambitions tied to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) '
            'hang in the balance as violence against Chinese nationals '
            'continues to rise.   — 20 Chinese nationals killed and 34 injured '
            'since 2021 — suggests the fragility of these investments amid '
            'unrelenting unrest. For the Baloch youth, the state’s apparent '
            'indifference to their activism, coupled with Pakistan’s internal '
            'political distractions, presents both challenges and '
            'opportunities. Moreover, Islamabad’s preoccupation with political '
            'crises in Punjab and power struggles between the PTI and the '
            'establishment has left Balochistan on the margins of national '
            'priorities. Thus, the interplay between local activism, state '
            'policies, and regional geopolitics will ultimately determine '
            'whether Balochistan moves toward greater stability or deeper '
            'conflict in 2025.',

            '(FIA) that former prime minister Imran Khan had retained 108 '

            'involving a Bulgari jewellery set, allegedly purchased by Mr Khan '

            'a makeshift courtroom at Adiala Jail, where Mr Khan is '
            'incarcerated. Evidence presented to the court included records '
            'from 100 newspapers related to Toshakhana gifts, a detailed list '

            'over retaining a Graff jewellery set. She accused authorities of '
            'targeting her brother to suppress his political influence. She '
            'claimed that Mr Khan had reiterated his   for a judicial '
            'commission to investigate the May 9 and Nov 26 incidents. She '
            'said her brother has been in jail for nearly 18 months and '
            'refused any deals with the establishment or foreign powers. She '
            'expressed confidence that the Tos\xadh\xada\xadkhana and Al-Qadir '
            'University cases, in which a decision is   on Jan 6, would '
            'ultimately be resolved in the higher courts. She urged '
            'authorities to prioritise natio\xadnal security over political '
            'vendettas. Aleema Khan revealed that Mr Khan had rejected offers '
            'of house arrest in Banigala, opting instead to fight all legal '
            'cases against him. “My brother believes the May 9 conspiracy was '
            'aimed at crushing PTI, which is why those who have left the party '
            'are roaming free,” she said. Meanwhile, PTI Central Information '
            'Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Ahmed, in   to Information Minister Atta '
            'Tarar’s White Paper on the PTI government’s performance in Khyber '
            'Pakhtunkhwa, said the people of KP had already delivered their '
            'verdict on PTI’s performance by re-electing it to power for a '
            'third consecutive term on Feb 8, 2024. He emphasised that the '
            'people of KP have consistently voted PTI into power with '
            'increasing strength, demonstrating their unwavering trust in the '
            'party and its founder. Mr Akram made it clear that Imran Khan '
            'predicted 2025 was a year of change because “power grabbers have '
            'ruined the entire country and the system cannot sustain it '
            'anymore”. In another development, Leader of the Opposition Omar '
            'Ayub Khan met Lord Qurban Hussain, a member of the UK’s House of '
            'Lords, at the opposition leader’s chamber in Parliament House, '
            'Islamabad. Both the leaders exchanged views on strengthening '
            'democracy and deepening relations between the two countries. '
            'Exchanging views on Pakistan’s current political climate, Mr Ayub '
            'emphasised that the rule of law, strong democratic institutions '

            'repression constitute the core of democracy and serve as '
            'intrinsic foundations to the progress and prosperity of any '
            'nation. Lord Qurban Hussain reaffirmed his steadfast commitment '
            'to strengthening Pakistan-UK relations and expressed his desire '

 'content': '‘WELL left’ is a term used in cricket when a batter judges the '
            'line and length of a potentially problematic ball correctly and, '
            'rather than taking the risk of playing it, covers up and, bat '
            'high in the air, lets it go harmlessly through to the '
            'wicket-keeper’s gloves. The moral of the story is that you don’t '
            'have to swing at every ball, especially the ones that are '
            'swinging and can take an edge and get you into trouble, even get '
            'you caught out. Evidently, the concept is alien to Pakistani '
            'politicians who have to have a go at every ball. The result: they '
            'make fools of themselves. The most recent example of this is the '
            'reaction to   calling for Imran Khan’s release by  , a former '
            'acting director of national intelligence and ambassador to '
            'Germany in the last Trump administration, who has been   by '
            'president-elect Donald Trump as a presidential envoy for special '
            'missions. Having ceded a walkover to the PTI in '
            'narrative-building within the country and effective lobbying '
            'abroad, many PML-N politicians took it upon themselves to respond '
            'to the Trump aide on social media with details of their own '
            'persecution whilst Imran Khan was in power. If they had any '
            'sense, they’d get professionals to run their narrative-building '
            'in the US. If they thought the detractor would reach for a box of '
            'tissues, they were dead wrong. Their responses, which fuelled '
            'more tweets by the American political figure, betrayed their '
            'utter and complete failure in understanding the system of '
            'lobbying and funding of politicians seeking public office in the '
            'US. If this is how the hybrid set-up aims to respond to '
            'challenges emerging from the new American president taking office '
            'in less than a month’s time, then the fate of their narrative '
            'will be no different abroad to the lost battle at home. If they '
            'had any sense, they’d get professionals with expertise and a '
            'track record in the US to run their narrative-building in that '
            'country, as they seem to care deeply about perceptions in '
            'Washington. A far less damaging option than mounting an '
            'ill-informed defence on social media would be to stay silent till '
            'such time as the challenge comes via official channels and '
            'relates to the specifics. In Pakistan, a solidly assembled '
            'narrative can be, and is being, countered with state oppression. '
            'Even if people don’t believe you, they have been browbeaten into '
            'near submission and, therefore, the success of their narrative '
            'will have to wait till the next electoral round to manifest '
            'itself. Taking a sledgehammer to the task, does not work beyond '
            'your coercive reach. Perhaps, the only entity in the world which '
            'has long lost the narratives war around the world but goes on '
            'relentlessly, as if that loss was no more than a minor '
            'inconvenience, is the State of Israel which has a free pass to '
            'carry out a genocide in full public view in the 21st century and '
            'yet not have to pause. Not just that. Any and every conscientious '
            'objection to this mass murder is dubbed antisemitic. But the '
            'apartheid state’s effective lobbying, funding of public '
            'officials’ election campaigns, and media control delivers it the '
            'sort of impunity that is rarely evidenced elsewhere. This in '
            'addition to historical reasons, of course. Perhaps, someone in '
            'government should examine how groups such as the American Israel '
            'Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) in the US, and similarly in the '
            'UK the Labour Friends of Israel and Conservative Friends of '
            'Israel to quote just two examples, operate, and the decisive '
            'influence they exert on policymakers and policies in the two '
            'countries. Overseas Pakistanis, especially in the US who support '
            'the PTI, have a very good understanding of how the wheels of '
            'power turn in that country and know well that those who grease '
            'them with campaign funds will always have a sympathetic ear in '
            'the corridors of power. This is not to say that their influence '
            'rivals, or comes anywhere near, that of Aipac for one. Even then, '
            'as is being seen, they enjoy far more influence with the incoming '
            'US administration than the hybrid government does and this may be '
            'a factor that could come into play in the coming months. At the '
            'same time, it would be important to see things in their proper '
            'context. The incoming administration will have China’s growing '
            'power and influence, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Middle East '
            'conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians to deal with '
            'first. In line with how the US wants to shape the Middle East, it '
            'will push for further progress on developments such as the '
            'Abraham Accords and try and persuade Saudi Arabia to join the UAE '
            'and others who have ‘normalised’ relations with Israel. For now, '
            'at least Saudi Arabia has made its normalisation conditional on a '
            '‘two-state solution’. Whether Riyadh will have enough leverage '
            'with Washington to have its voice heard is not clear, '
            'particularly when Israel has rejected any such solution and also '
            'embarked on its Greater Israel plan with additional land grabs in '
            'Syria and Lebanon in the first phase. Iran will be in America’s '
            'and its key ally in the region Israel’s crosshairs, especially '
            'Tehran’s nuclear and missile programme. Viewed against this '
            'backdrop, Pakistani politics and what is happening within the '
            'country may merit more than a statement every now and then to '
            'reflect the lobbyists’ efforts. Nonetheless, Trump’s '
            'unpredictability will remain a source for anxiety in Islamabad. '
            'On the other hand, for years and years, Pakistan’s relations with '
            'the US have been dictated by the relations between the Pentagon '
            'and GHQ and are likely to remain that way for the foreseeable '
            'future. Pentagon spokesman Maj-Gen Pat Ryder’s tone, tenor and '
            'substance was in stark contrast to US presidential deputy '
            'security adviser Jon Finer’s bizarre claim about Pakistan’s '
            'missile programme. Therefore, Pakistani politicians would be '
            'well-advised to learn the merits of a ‘well left’ policy rather '
            'than hang their bats out when they have no idea what the ball '
            'will do. That would be a safe and prudent thing to do.',

            'like Black Friday sales and Valentine’s Day celebrations, we have '
            'yet to get on to the Thanksgiving bandwagon. Before anyone '
            'accuses us of mindlessly ‘mimicking the West’, we have adapted '
            'these traditions with a local twist; we localised Black Friday as '
            'Blessed Friday, and lads send red roses and chocolates to their '
            'moms as per our version of Valentine’s Day. Actually, we observe '
            'so many black days that this legally teetotalling country can '
            'technically be black-labelled. While the tradition of pardoning '
            'the Thanksgiving turkey is traced to Abraham Lincoln in 1863, '
            'granting a pardon or clemency for crimes against the US is said '
            'to have preceded it. George Washington exercised this power on '
            'Nov 2, 1795, when he pardoned two men sentenced to be hanged in '
            'the Whiskey Rebellion. It is interesting to note how little is '
            'known about this event in American history compared to the Boston '
            'Tea Party, though both concerned taxes on beverages. The former '
            'concerned levies on distilleries owned by small farmers, while '
            'the latter concerned the tea tax imposed by the British '
            'parliament on the colonists in Massachusetts. Returning to '
            'pardons, among the more infamous recipients is Richard Nixon, '
            'whom Gerald Ford pardoned for any crimes he might have committed '
            'during the Watergate scandal. This instance also stands out as a '
            'pre-emptive pardon because Nixon was not charged with or '
            'convicted of federal crimes. He had stepped down in the face of '
            'an impeachment by Congress. George H.W. Bush also granted a '
            'pre-emptive pardon to former secretary of state Caspar Weinberger '
            'and former CIA official Duane Claridge in the Iran-Contra affair '
            'in 1992. Joe Biden, the outgoing US president, among his last '
            'acts of charity — remember, it begins at home — has pardoned his '
            'son Hunter, who was embroiled in tax evasion and illegal weapons '
            'cases. To lessen the burden of nepotism, he has commuted the '
            'sentences of almost all death-row convicts in federal prisons. '
            'Isn’t it time we spared the ‘poultry’ little guys, the citizens? '
            'Donald Trump, the president-elect, may use this power to pardon '
            'scores of Jan 6, 2021, insurrectionists who planned to take over '
            'the nation’s capital in their refusal to accept the election '
            'results in favour of the Democrats. The US constitution does not '
            'expressly grant immunity to the president in civil or criminal '
            'cases. However, to make up for this sad oversight by the founding '
            'fathers, they can pardon anyone, including themselves, of any '
            'crime other than impeachment by Congress.  We should adopt '
            'Thanksgiving, if for nothing else than the presidential tradition '
            'of pardoning the turkey. How long would we pardon the sacred cows '
            'only? Isn’t it time we spared the ‘poultry’ little guys, the '
            'citizens? Article 45 of the Constitution of Pakistan vests the '
            'power to pardon in the head of state. Whether this power is '
            'absolute or not is occasionally raised before the courts of law. '
            'Former Jamaat-i-Islami ameer Sirajul Haq moved a bill in the '
            'Senate to amend Article 45 by inserting language that puts '
            'convictions under qisas and diyat outside the purview of the '
            'presidential pardon because, according to Sharia laws, only the '
            'heirs have the right to pardon.  While legal and parliamentary '
            'wrangling over the issue continues, ways have been devised never '
            'to let such matters get presidential; they are taken care of at a '
            'very pedestrian level, usually at the police station. If the '
            'accused are powerful, they would entice and harass the heirs into '
            'pardoning them.  The worst offenders are rarely apprehended, '
            'arraigned, tried, and convic\xadted. If the law-en\xadforcement '
            'apparatus is not suffici- ently negligent or complicit in the '
            'crime, or if an of\xad\xadfender voluntarily surrenders and co- '
            'n\xad\xadfesses, the autho\xadrities do their best to drag their '
            'undertrial status for as long as it takes to organise a '
            'jailbreak.  After that, it is just a matter of a safe passage '
            'being arranged across the Durand Line and a fact-finding '
            'committee or two, which usually finds a lack of funding for '
            'prisons and lock-ups responsible for ‘lax security’. So as not to '
            'feel utterly powerless in this domain, the heads of state usually '
            'commute sentences of prisoners by a few months come Eid or '
            'Independence Day. These remissions are generally restricted to '
            'prisoners whose crimes are not heinous.  In many countries, the '
            'powers to pardon extend beyond individuals, and entire '
            'communities can benefit. Since the term ‘pardon’ presumes guilt, '
            'or at least suspicion of it, if fellow citizens expect to be '
            'spared further torture at the hands of the inept and apathetic, '
            'they will have to confess their act of omission, ie, failure to '

 'content': 'IT is hard to imagine how someone changes the course of their '
            'life — more so when that person is a top jihadist leader on the '
            'world’s most-wanted terrorist lists and admits that taking the '
            'militant path had been a mistake. That he follows up this '
            'ostensible change of heart by working to reintegrate former '
            'militants into society comes across as practically bizarre. This '
            'is not a tale from war-torn Syria, where militant leaders are '
            'rethinking their roles, nor is it from East Asia, where many '
            'former fighters embraced ideological transformations. This story '
            'unfolds in Pakistan and centres on a man who joined the jihad '
            'against the Soviets at a young age, eventually becoming the '
            'supreme commander of the largest militant group in Kashmir. '
            'According to accounts in jihadi circles, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, '
            'the supreme commander of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), '
            'underwent a period of ‘rethinking’ during his confinement '
            'following his arrest in connection with the November 2008 Mumbai '
            'attacks. While the US and India remained sceptical about the '
            'seriousness of his detention, and their media frequently '
            'highlighted reports of him receiving royal treatment during his '
            'incarceration, including access to various facilities and regular '
            'interactions with family and friends, prolonged separation from '
            'the jihadist fields and camps is said to have offered Lakhvi and '
            'some colleagues an opportunity to reflect on the evolving global '
            'and political landscape and ongoing discussions about jihad and '
            'terrorism within militant circles. At the time, groups like the '
            'Pakistani Taliban, Al Qaeda, and the militant Islamic State group '
            'had emerged as significant sources of inspiration for jihadists, '
            'prompting debates about ideology and strategy within these '
            'networks. Though surprising, the transformation of militants in '
            'prison is not a unique phenomenon. Similar instances have '
            'occurred in Egypt, where Al Jihad leaders renounced violence, and '
            'even within Al Qaeda, where one of its ideologues, Dr Fadl, '
            'engaged in a significant debate with Ayman al-Zawahiri, '
            'criticising the indiscriminate use of violence as a means for '
            'change. Likewise, Jemaah Islamiyah militants, led by Nasir Abbas, '
            'underwent a similar process while in Jakarta jail. The '
            'transformation of militants in prison is not a unique phenomenon. '
            'Deradicalisation initiatives in prisons have also gained '
            'popularity in Europe and Arab countries, particularly in Saudi '
            'Arabia. Despite ongoing debates about their success rates, these '
            'programmes have led to the ideological transformation of several '
            'militants. Pakistan adopted a similar approach, establishing '
            'deradicalisation camps in Swat and other parts of KP to address '
            'extremism among detained militants. Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi’s case '
            'stands out on several counts. He fought in Afghanistan and '
            'Indian-held Kashmir as a ‘legitimate proxy’, influenced by the '
            'ideas of holy war and the Salafi interpretation of jihad. Unlike '
            'many Pakistani militants who became disillusioned with state-led '
            'jihad and joined groups like Al Qaeda, TTP, or later IS, Lakhvi '
            'did not turn against the state and maintained the allegiance of '
            'his cadre to his organisation. This persisted even during his '
            'arrest in connection with the Mumbai attacks, his subsequent '
            'release by Pakistani courts, and later, his re-arrest on terror '
            'financing charges. Pakistan has come a long way in loosening its '
            'reliance on militant proxies, a policy that inflicted severe '
            'human losses, damaged the social fabric of society, and caused '
            'significant political, strategic, and diplomatic setbacks to the '
            'country. Intense international pressure, including from friendly '
            'countries like China, and the Financial Action Task Force, '
            'compelled state institutions to reassess this approach. During '
            'this transitional phase, many militants from groups, including '
            'LeT, became disillusioned and joined organisations such as IS and '
            'Al Qaeda. In response, the state began experimenting with efforts '
            'to mainstream militant groups. The banned Jamaatud Dawa, the '
            'parent organisation of LeT, attempted to integrate into '
            'mainstream politics. However, several factors hindered its '
            'success, mainly its militant credentials, lack of political '
            'vision, and its Salafi ideology, which is not widely popular in '
            'Pakistan, where the Hanafi school dominates, followed by the Shia '
            'school of thought. As a result, JuD struggled to create '
            'significant political traction eventually becoming little more '
            'than a political proxy for state institutions. Lakhvi was '
            'apparently sceptical about the organisation’s political project, '
            'initiating a separate course to create job opportunities for his '
            'cadre and engaging in discussions on renouncing violence. It is '
            'interesting that JuD, led by Hafiz Saeed, chose the other course '
            'and continued exploiting the tendencies of violence. This was '
            'dichotomous in that one side of the group was apparently trying '
            'to become part of mainstream politics, and the other side would '
            'not abandon its mantra about fighting in Kashmir. The reason was '
            'that the leadership was afraid that it would lose ground if it '
            'abandoned the jihad policy and the funds it collected in the name '
            'of jihad in Kashmir. Hafiz Saeed, along with his family members, '
            'had a strong grip on the organisation and its resources. Going by '
            'jihadi accounts, Lakhvi, one of the group’s founders, has been '
            'sidelined, and a campaign against him has been launched. One '
            'interesting argument in this campaign is that he has been '
            'converted to what is being referred to as Mohammed bin Salman’s '
            'version of Islam. Within the Salafi school of thought, a '
            'significant discussion is ongoing regarding the direction they '
            'should take after the substantial political and ideological '
            'shifts in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed bin Salman does not enjoy a '
            'favourable image among Pakistan’s Salafists. However, they cannot '
            'openly voice their concerns because of their financial dependence '
            'on Saudi Arabia and the educational scholarships offered by Saudi '
            'universities, which remain critical lifelines. Additionally, the '
            'Pakistani state restricts criticism of the Saudi royal family due '
            'to its own financial reliance on Saudi support. This debate is '
            'also alive within JuD groups, making it increasingly difficult '
            'for their leadership to maintain loyalty to the Saudis while '
            'continuing their jihadist politics. Although Hafiz and Lakhvi’s '
            'factions have recently reconciled, allowing Lakhvi to demonstrate '
            'some of his influence in Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, internal '
            'frictions are far from resolved. These tensions are expected to '
            'persist for the foreseeable future.',

 'content': 'ON Oct 20, 2024, Egypt received a certificate from the World '
            'Health Organisation (WHO) declaring it malaria-free. A disease '
            'that once plagued the pharaohs is now history. Health experts '
            'noted that this milestone marked the end of malaria as a threat '
            'to Egypt. Achieving malaria-free status requires three '
            'consecutive years without a single case of local transmission, '
            'and Egypt met this rigorous criterion. Maintaining this success, '
            'however, remains a priority. For countries like Pakistan, where '
            'cases of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases are on the '
            'rise, Egypt’s success offers valuable lessons. Why has Egypt been '
            'able to achieve this victory, while nations like Pakistan '
            'continue to struggle? What lessons can be learned from Egypt’s '
            'approach to eliminating malaria, and why is it crucial for '
            'Pakistan to take similar steps? Understanding Egypt’s journey can '
            'help policymakers and health professionals in Pakistan identify '
            'what may be hindering progress and the potential consequences of '
            'not acting swiftly. Egypt’s victory against malaria represents '
            'the culmination of decades of concerted efforts spanning nearly a '
            'century. This achievement relied on a multifaceted and '
            'multidimensional approach encompassing public awareness, vector '
            'control, disease management, and environmental improvement. Key '
            'initiatives included large-scale drainage projects aimed at '
            'removing stagnant water from the Nile delta, agricultural fields, '
            'and irrigation canals. Stagnant water serves as a breeding ground '
            'for Anopheles mosquitoes, the primary vectors of malaria. '
            'Additionally, irrigation systems were modified to ensure '
            'continuous water flow, significantly reducing breeding sites. To '
            'minimise environmental harm and prevent mosquito resistance, '
            'Egypt implemented the rotation of safer insecticides. This '
            'ensured that mosquitoes did not develop immunity to control '
            'measures. Biological control methods also played a crucial role: '
            'mosquito-eating fish were introduced into irrigation canals and '
            'other water bodies, while specific vegetation was planted to '
            'attract natural mosquito predators, fostering an environment '
            'where mosquito populations could be naturally suppressed. Year '
            'after year, Pakistan sees the tragic loss of lives across all age '
            'groups due to vector-borne diseases. Robust surveillance networks '
            'were established to monitor areas with historical malaria '
            'transmission. Health workers collected data, tracked potential '
            'outbreaks, and ensured prompt action. Public health campaigns '
            'educated rural communities on the importance of eliminating '
            'mosquito breeding sites near homes, using bed nets, and seeking '
            'early treatment for symptoms. Commu\xadnity participation was '
            'another cornerstone of the strategy. Residents were trained to '
            'identify mosquito breeding grounds and encouraged to report '
            'stagnant water. This active involvement turned local populations '
            'into key partners in the malaria elimination exercise. Given the '
            'risk posed by travellers from malaria-endemic regions such as '
            'sub-Saharan Africa, strict screening protocols were implemented. '
            'Imported cases were promptly treated to prevent re-establishment '
            'of local transmission. In Pakistan, the battle against '
            'vector-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue haemorrhagic '
            'fever, and malaria has escalated into a national health crisis. '
            'Despite support from international organisations like the WHO and '
            'numerous government and NGO campaigns, these infections continue '
            'to exact a heavy toll. All segments are affected — from rural '
            'communities to urban populations — underscoring these diseases’ '
            'pervasive nature. Year after year, Pakistan sees the tragic loss '
            'of lives across all age groups due to these diseases. An '
            'extremely concerning factor is the limited availability of '
            'vaccines for most vector-borne diseases, leaving prevention '
            'efforts heavily reliant on vector control. While promising '
            'vaccines for diseases like malaria are under development '
            'globally, they remain inaccessible to many in Pakistan, '
            'highlighting the urgent need for proactive measures to nip the '
            'spread of diseases in the bud. Given today’s interconnectedness, '
            'the concept of ‘no one is safe until everyone is safe’ rings '
            'especially true for Pakistan. As part of the global community, it '
            'is imperative for the country to adopt practical and '
            'evidence-based measures, inspired by success stories like Egypt. '
            'A foundational step in this direction is to address '
            'mosquito-breeding sites, a common factor in the spread of most '
            'vector-borne diseases in the country. Stagnant water, heaps of '
            'garbage, and unattended litter provide ideal conditions for '
            'mosquitoes to thrive. Taking control of these breeding grounds '
            'can mitigate the spread of disease. Educational initiatives must '
            'also be prioritised. Raising awareness at schools, colleges, '
            'universities, and in rural communities is crucial for long-term '
            'success. Media outlets, with their extensive reach, can play a '
            'transformative role by broadcasting public health messages and '
            'promoting preventative practices. Media can play a pivotal role '
            'by educating the public through schools, universities, and rural '
            'outreach programmes, ensuring that no area is overlooked by the '
            'health authorities. Community involvement is equally critical. '
            'Encouraging citizens to report mosquito-breeding sites and '
            'fostering a culture of environmental responsibility can amplify '
            'the impact of government and NGO efforts. Additionally, livestock '
            'and domestic animals, which often serve as hosts for fleas and '
            'ticks that transmit diseases, require focused attention. '
            'Collaborative efforts among the health authorities, NGOs, and '
            'agricultural agencies can help manage and control these vector '
            'populations. The generation and maintenance of comprehensive '
            'biostatistical data on vector-borne diseases is essential too. By '
            'regularly updating and analysing this data, policymakers and '
            'health professionals can identify trends, assess the '
            'effectiveness of interventions, and adapt strategies to emerging '
            'challenges. Such data-driven approaches are critical for '
            'sustaining progress and ensuring that efforts are targeted where '
            'they are needed most. Egypt’s systematic efforts demonstrate that '
            'combating malaria is not just about resources but also strategic '
            'implementation and community involvement. These are lessons '
            'Pakistan can readily adapt to its unique challenges. Despite '
            'having the potential to implement similar strategies, Pakistan '
            'has struggled with inconsistent efforts in malaria control, '
            'hindered by gaps in the public health infrastructure, limited '
            'community participation, and lack of sustained political will. By '
            'learning from the success of other countries in their fight '
            'against various diseases and adopting integrated strategies and a '
            'multidimensional approach, Pakistan can work towards controlling '
            'and even eradicating these diseases. Taking inspiration from '
            'Egypt’s comprehensive approach could help it move towards a '
            'future where malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases are no '
            'longer a threat to its people.',

            'access to elite educational institutes and good jobs. Covid-19 '
            'added a new dimension to shadow education in the form of virtual '
            'lessons and tutoring, leading to a third model of learning that '
            'makes shadow education more needs-based, self-paced, and '
            'personalised with the integration of technologies. Shadow '
            'education also offers an alternative career path and an '
            'additional earning avenue for educated youth and is a potential '

            'learning has been accepted, there is little debate about its '
            'potency and shortcomings. Traditionally, shadow education is used '
            'interchangeably with ‘tuitions’, which are managed beyond school '
            'hours, with additional costs and in private settings. Shadow '
            'education comprises diverse learning events such as summer camps, '
            'extra evening classes, preparation for competitive exams and '
            'institutional entry tests. The focus is on addressing learners’ '
            'deficiencies in particular subjects, all of which come at an '
            'additional cost. The financial cost makes it accessible to the '
            'wealthy, with many others not able to afford it. Shadow education '
            'gives the offspring of the rich more opportunities for further '
            'education and jobs. Wealth-based access to shadow education '
            'exposes the divide between ‘privileged’ and ‘underprivileged’ '
            'learners. Effective education takes place in a more diverse '
            'social ecology. The larger social cost is that the educational '
            'landscape becomes vulnerable to greater learning inequalities, '
            'with education becoming more of a commodity. The resort to shadow '
            'education also reflects how schools may not be catering to '
            'parents’ wishes regarding the education of their children. '
            'Moreover, teachers in shadow education settings are more '
            'responsive to learners’ needs than they may be in schools, and '
            'the students thrive as compared to those who study only in '
            'school. Thus, there is a level of parental trust associated with '
            'shadow education, even though the latter only deepens the gap '
            'between itself and formal education. There is another aspect to '
            'dwell on: children pay a price for having to experience both '
            'formal and shadow education settings. Being part of a controlled '
            'environment — whether in formal or informal settings — can '
            'negatively affect their intellectual and social potential. In '
            'Pakistan, in both spaces, they are often likely to find '
            'themselves a part of a reduced canvas of learning filled with '
            'homogeneous content, and pedagogy that compromises true learning '
            'and prepares them only for tests and exams. Effective learning '
            'occurs in a broader and more diverse social ecology and is driven '
            'by genuine curiosity on the part of learners, and a committed '
            'approach to teaching by their instructors. In shadow education '
            'settings, after a hectic day at school, students may experience '
            'symptoms of burnout and come to look upon learning as a burden '
            'rather than an exercise in curiosity and exploration. They may '
            'appear bookish but are not able to apply the knowledge that they '
            'have gained to real-life issues. We should ask ourselves whether '
            'our children really need additional time to learn if they already '
            'spend a good part of their day at school — despite the advantages '
            'of shadow education. And whether this adds to their learning or '
            'is just an extra burden. How does it af\xad\xadfect their '
            'soc\xadi\xad\xadal life and int\xade\xadractions with '
            'fa\xad\xadmily, friends, and society? Perhaps it is time to '
            'monitor the cost of shadow education — and not just in monetary '
            'terms — to prevent the excessive commodification of education and '
            'the exploitation of families.  The government may harness shadow '
            'education as an effort to address the issue of out-of-school '

            'play out. Trump’s statements on Ukraine suggesting a radical '
            'shift in policy seem to be making European governments nervous. '
            'Often claiming he can end the war “in a day”, Trump is expected '

            'which Ukraine has to cede territory. Trump has also repeatedly '
            'said he wants to end the war in the Middle East and ensure a '
            'ceasefire in Gaza. While he has avoided specifics, this will '
            'almost certainly be on Israel’s terms. He has said the US should '
            'stay out of Syria, but it is hard to see how it can do that given '
            'the complex regional ramifications of regime change there.      '

            'is not entitled to inherit any share from the estate of a Muslim '
            'relative, eit\xadher as a successor or predecessor. Justice '
            'Chaudhry Muhammad Iqbal issued the ruling upholding the decisions '
            'of two lower courts regarding a devolution of a land measuring 83 '
            'kanals in Gojra tehsil of Toba Tek Singh district. The landowner '
            'was Muslim by faith and after his demise the property was '
            'devolved to his children — three sons and two daughters. However, '
            'a Muslim grandson of the deceased challenged the mutation in '
            'favour of one of his uncles while alleging that the latter was an '
            'Ahmadi by faith and as such he could not inherit the property '
            'from the estate of his deceased Muslim father. The courts decreed '
            'in favour of the grandson who sought cancellation of the '
            'subsequent mutations. During the cross-examination, one of the '
            'heirs of the non-Muslim man also testified that his father was an '
            'Ahmadi.      Justice Iqbal observed it was an admitted position '
            'that the man was an Ahmadi by faith, but he did not disclose the '
            'same while incorporating the inheritance mutation of his Muslim '
            'father.  “It is settled law that admitted facts need not to be '
            'prov\xaded,” the judge maintained. The judge asserted that as per '
            'Sharia, the estate left by a deceased Muslim owner cannot be '
            'inherited by a non-Muslim heir. To explain this point, he quoted '
            'the saying of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) from Vol. 4 of '
            'Sahih Muslim: “A Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever and a '
            'disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim.” Justice Iqbal '
            'observed that in the British rule the personal laws of the '
            'respective communities dwelling in India were protected through '
            'promulgation of legislated law. Similarly, he said, the   were '
            'also made applicable to the Muslims through Muslim Shariat '
            'Application Act, 1937.  Therefore, he added, the canon of the '
            'Holy Quran and Sunnah are applicable to inheritance of the estate '
            'of a deceased Muslim. Considering these facts, the judge ruled '
            'that a non-Muslim was not entitled to inherit any share from the '
            'estate of his Muslim relative as successor or predecessor. Also, '
            'the provisions of Article 260(3), which defines the terms Muslim '
            'and non-Muslim for legal purposes, are applicable, '
            'retrospectively, he explained. The LHC noted that the trial court '
            'rightly decreed the suit, which was lawfully upheld by the '
            'appellate court. While dismissing the petition, the judge '
            'concluded, “The concurrent findings of fact are against the '

            'India, who deplored an “American culture” that he said venerates '
            'mediocrity, adding that the United States risks having “our asses '
            'handed to us by China.” That angered several prominent '

            'of subjects, including the reasons behind the upsurge in '
            'terrorism, the military’s issues with the PTI, as well as the '
            'critical situation in Kurram tribal district. He also observed '
            'that it was not a good idea for the PTI government at the time to '
            'initiate a dialogue with the banned TTP in 2021. Lt-Gen Ahmed '
            'Chaudhry said that the “illegal spectrum” in the country had '
            'political backing. While the politicians are guilty of many sins, '
            'other institutions are not without blame either, as they have not '
            'done enough to stop illegality, and in some instances have even '
            'backed unconstitutional moves. So to pillory the politicians '
            'alone — which the establishment has been doing since the Ayub era '
            '— is hardly fair. Where the factors that are fuelling militancy '
            'are concerned, the general was not wrong when he said that '
            'terrorism will cease when there is “justice … education, health” '
            'and good governance. Indeed, in the ex-Fata areas, which have '
            'become hotbeds of militant activity, integration has been slow '
            'and good governance lacking. So while the security forces have '
            'succeeded in the ‘clear’ and ‘hold’ dimensions, the civil '
            'administration has failed in the ‘build’ phase.\n'
            'Without the underdeveloped areas of KP and Balochistan receiving '
            'the same facilities as the settled areas or urban Pakistan, the '
            'militants will continue to exploit such inequalities. Regarding '
            'the PTI   with the TTP, it is hard to imagine that the '
            'establishment was not on board when these parleys were initiated. '
            'In fact, even after Imran Khan’s departure from PM House, the '
            'process continued for some time. So, once again, the civilian '
            'leadership alone is not to blame for misguided policies. As for '
            'the general’s comment that Kurram is a “tribal land dispute”, '
            'that may be true, but other factors, such as sectarianism and '
            'militancy, cannot be brushed aside. Moreover, the blockade of '
            'Kurram, and the gruesome murders of innocent travellers on its '
            'roads, point to a far more sinister and complicated issue than '
            'just tribal real estate claims. It is welcome that the powers '
            'that be are willing to look into the factors fuelling terrorism. '
            'However, such introspection needs to be holistic. The mistakes '
            'made by all state institutions need to be acknowledged, and a way '
            'forward found. All institutions must speak in unison against '
            'illegal activities in the country. Moreover, rather than '
            'indulging in blame games, the political leadership and the '
            'military’s top brass, as well as other stakeholders, need to '
            'discuss both short- and long-term strategies to eradicate '
            'terrorism. These include kinetic actions, as well as sincere '
            'efforts to establish good governance and health and education '
            'facilities in the areas where militants go scouting for ‘talent’.',

            'breaking them and setting new ones, the market is still below its '
            'last peak in 2017. “The stock market is still trading at a 50 per '
            'cent discount in dollar terms compared to previous peaks when it '
            'was at $100 billion in 2017. We expect a sharp rally in 2025, '
            'assuming there is no political upheaval,” said Ali Nawaz, CEO of '
            'Chase Securities. The decline since 2017, as highlighted in a '
            'LinkedIn post by Sohail Mohammed, CEO of Topline Securities, can '
            'be attributed to factors such as the rupee’s devaluation, large '
            'dividend payouts, and fewer new listings. Small investors and '
            'brokerage houses alike seem to expect the rallies to continue, '

            'money out of T-bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds and into the '

            'price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 6, less than 8.3x, the '
            'mean for the last decade. Mathematically, a PE ratio is the price '

            'in the future. No one is under the illusion that Pakistan’s '
            'economy has fundamentally improved. Some cautious investors have '
            'stayed out of the market, fearing it to be a bubble. However, Mr '

            'sharply in the last four to five years, but although the earnings '
            'per share have improved, they were not reflected in the prices. '

            'from the pandemic  , followed by the   and the resultant '
            'commodity price shocks that led to a near-default situation, as '
            'well as the  As the economy stabilises, companies’ share prices '
            'better reflect their corporate earnings, hence the slew of '
            'rallies in the PSX, explains Mr Nawaz.      Background '
            'conversations with the average Ammar Akbar Anthony investing in '
            'the PSX, revealed a range of sentiments. Satisfaction for being '
            'able to recoup past losses, regret for getting in too late or '
            'leaving the rally too early, optimism that the ride will continue '
            'into 2025, and fear that this was all a bubble waiting to '
            'collapse. The last concern stems from the general understanding '
            'at the educated grassroots level that Pakistan has stabilised but '
            'not reformed structurally. However, the restrictions on purchases '
            'of the dollar and its relative stability have made it a less '
            'lucrative investment. An increase in tax compliance and the '
            'Federal Bureau of Revenue’s valuation of property rates has '

            'market, driving the bulls. As big money, in the form of '
            'institutional buying, drove the index up, the retail investors '

            'market cap increased by 198pc, 182pc, and 130pc, respectively. '

            'government sold electricity below cost, causing delays in cash '
            'flow. The IMF has insisted that costs be passed on to consumers — '
            'hence the sky-high tariffs and resultant inflation but increased '
            'liquidity and stabilised revenue streams. Monetary policy — the '
            'interest rate set by the central bank — is a favoured tool to '
            'control inflation and is one used by central banks globally. To '
            'curtail record-high inflation, the State Bank of Pakistan '
            'resorted to a record high monetary policy rate of 22pc. The '
            'commercial banks lending to the government were the biggest '
            'beneficiaries. Banks invested in truckloads of T-bills and PIBs, '
            'and their profits increased 2x-3c over the last few years, but '
            'their share prices did not rise proportionately owing to the '
            'political turmoil, explains Mr Nawaz. As the market re-rates '
            'itself, the financial sector’s share prices rose, driving up the '
            'index. John Koch, senior investment analyst at US-based iSectors, '
            'considers the PSX market undervalued, even after the strong '
            'performance in 2024. Comparing PSX’s price-to-earnings ratio and '
            'price-to-book ratio to other emerging market indices, Mr Koch '
            'says the ratios look favourable for Pakistan compared to peers. '
            'Why, then, can Pakistan not attract investment into the stock '
            'exchange from abroad? Mr Koch answers, saying that geopolitical '
            'tensions are important concerns. “One development which could '
            'significantly boost Pakistan’s economic outlook is the discovery '
            'of substantial oil reserves in territorial waters. If these '
            'reserves prove to be good and the proper infrastructure is '
            'developed, which has long been an issue for Pakistan, then the '
            'country could become largely energy independent. For now, one '
            'must remain sceptical of Pakistan’s ability to refine any oil '
            'that it discovers,” he says. “If political, military, and '
            'economic stability can improve, foreign investment would likely '
            'increase. Broad instability makes Pakistan a risky investment. It '
            'is a difficult cycle for any country to escape,” he adds. '
            '“Currency stability is extremely crucial,” adds Sean Pinch, '
            'Associate Investment Analyst at iSectors. A large portion of the '
            'returns earned from investing in foreign markets, especially '
            'those in developing countries, can be attributed to the movement '
            'of the foreign currency against the domestic currency of the '
            'country in which the investor resides. The PSX has been much more '
            'volatile compared to the MSCI Frontier Markets Index, and a more '
            'stable currency would go a long way in helping to reduce that '
            'volatility, he explains. A time-travelling DeLorean from ‘Back to '
            'the Future’ would be one surefire way to know how the PSX will '
            'act in the new year. Broadly, the consensus is that the bull run '
            'will continue. However, political stability has often been a '
            'mirage in Pakistan, leading to economic instability. If all '
            'things remain the same, there will be more Akbars than Anthonys '
            'in the PSX roulette.',

 'content': 'JOHANNESBURG: There were doubts over Pakistan’s One-day '
            'International form when the team departed for Australia in the '
            'final days of October, given that they failed badly in their last '
            'assignment in the format at that point; missing out on the '
            'semi-finals in the 2023 World Cup. Fast-forward to Sunday, the '
            'side has won three ODI series in a row, beating  ,   and   away '
            'from home. Led by Mohammad Rizwan, who took the team’s charge '
            'days before the Australia tour started, Pakistan now look like a '
            'well-oiled machine; their composition featuring a blend of '
            'experienced players and fresh faces. The unit announced itself as '
            'favourites to win next year’s ICC Champions Trophy at home, and '
            'so in style; completing a whitewash over the South Africans with '
            'a 36-run win in the third ODI on Sunday. The match saw opener '
            'Saim Ayub hit a century and spinner Sufiyan Muqeem putting the '
            'game to bed later on. The contest also featured crucial '
            'half-centuries by Rizwan himself and his predecessor Babar Azam. '
            '“… if you look at the last three series, Allah has granted us '
            'victories, I believe the youngsters played a key role in this,” '
            'Rizwan said in the post-match press conference. “We cannot say '
            'that only senior players performed; if you look at the Australia, '
            'Zimbabwe, and South Africa [series], both young and senior '
            'players are there, and the combination of the two has been '
            'effective.” It was Saim’s second ton of the series and a '
            'continuation of his form that seemed to start complimenting his '
            'much talked-about natural talent when he scored a match-winning '
            '82 against Australia. The stylish southpaw would go on to hit his '
            'maiden ODI century against Zimbabwe and a 98 not out in the '
            'second T20 against South Africa before winning the ODI series for '
            'Pakistan. In the second ODI, another domestic cricket '
            'high-achiever in Kamran Ghulam hit a 32-ball 63 to take the '
            'visitors to a match-winning score. Meanwhile, white-ball '
            'vice-captain Salman Ali Agha stood out with impactful '
            'performances both with the bat and the ball. “As far as new '
            'players are concerned, there is a lot of potential in Pakistan, '
            'and there are many performers,” said Rizwan. “If you look at the '
            'domestic scene, many players have been performing for a long '
            'time, and everyone knows that domestic cricket in Pakistan is '
            'very tough. “If our players perform well there, especially the '
            'youngsters, it gives us hope that they can perform well at the '
            'international level as well.” Rizwan’s captaincy too received '
            'praise from critics and the wicket-keeper put light on his '
            'thoughts about making the best of talented youngsters. “.. the '
            'real challenge is knowing where and how to use these players,” he '
            'observed. “Not every player suits every condition, and as a '
            'captain, you need to figure that out. If a youngster is '
            'performing, then you have to figure out the best way to use '
            'them.” The series also saw pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi return to '
            'form in the truest sense, looking as lethal as he was known to be '
            'before an injury in 2022 affected his place as the Pakistan pace '
            'spearhead. The left-armer took seven wickets at an impressive '
            'average of 23.28. Rizwan said himself and his fellow seasoned '
            'team-mates, despite having faced heavy criticism over the last '
            'couple of years, were not lacking in confidence.      “… if we '
            'talk about Babar Azam, Shaheen Shah Afridi, or Naseem Shah, they '
            'have played a lot of cricket and know exactly when and how to '
            'perform,” he said. “As for me, I have been playing cricket for a '
            'long time; I’ve played with Shaheen, Babar, Naseem, and all other '
            'players, so there isn’t much to talk about regarding confidence.” '
            'The captain noted he had a different equation with the '
            'youngsters. “With the senior players, I discuss different things, '
            'but with juniors, I try to assess the situation and figure out '
            'when they can perform best, whether they are bowlers or batsmen,” '
            'said Rizwan. While Pakistan have thrived in ODIs lately, their '
            'T20 form has nosedived. While admitting that the side needed to '
            'do better in the shortest format, Rizwan said the T20 results '
            'also pointed towards Pakistan’s focus on one-dayers, with their '
            'eye on the Champions Trophy. “Right now, we are focusing more on '
            'ODIs because we are trying to experiment with different things in '
            'T20,” he said. “You may have seen that senior players are being '
            'rested in T20, and we are trying different combinations. “But '
            'when you’re in an experimental mode, you focus on long-term '
            'goals, and some compromises may need to be made. As far as ODIs '
            'are concerned, our team is focused.” and we have decided to focus '

 'content': 'MELBOURNE: Indian captain Rohit Sharma has backed Virat Kohli to '
            'overcome his problems with deliveries outside the off-stump in '
            'Australia, saying on Tuesday that players of his calibre always '
            'find a way to succeed. Kohli arrested a long run of poor form '
            'with an unbeaten century in the first Test in Perth but has '
            'frequently chased balls moving away from his stumps in the '
            'current five-match series, resulting in his dismissal. '
            '“Modern-day greats will figure out their own ways [to deal with '
            'the issue],” Rohit told reporters ahead of the Boxing Day Test in '
            'Melbourne. Rohit’s own batting frailties in the longest format '
            'have been laid bare in recent matches. The captain has managed '
            'scores of three, six and 10 since rejoining the team for the '
            'second Test following the birth of his son. His move to the '
            'middle order has done little to inspire confidence but Rohit was '
            'tight-lipped about a potential switch back to the opening slot '
            'where he can be devastating. “Let’s not worry about that. I think '
            '‘who bats where?’ is something that we need to figure out within '
            'ourselves. It’s not a thing I should be discussing in every press '
            'conference. “Whatever it takes for our team to look good or gives '
            'us the best chance to succeed, we’ll try and do that.” After '
            'winning the first Test by 295 runs, India crashed to a 10-wicket '
            'defeat in Adelaide before battling to a draw in the rain-hit '
            'third match in Brisbane. “At 1-1, I think it’s a fair '
            'reflection,” Rohit added. “Both teams have played solid cricket '
            'and these two Tests are going to be so important for both teams. '
            '“We want to break it down to Melbourne and focus on what we can '
            'achieve here, get things right and play well.” India added '
            'uncapped Mumbai all-rounder Tanush Kotian to the squad for the '
            'final two tests after ruling out the inclusion of seamer Mohammed '
            'Shami due to a knee injury. Rohit was coy Tuesday on how his team '
            'will line up for the Boxing Day, with the option of a second '
            'spinner on the table. Temperatures are forecast to reach 40 '
            'degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, and the Melbourne '
            'Cricket Ground curator said during the week he expected the pitch '
            'to offer plenty for the fast bowlers. But Rohit left the door '
            'open to a second spinner. “Whatever we have to do to make the '
            'best possible XI in these conditions, we will do that — whether '
            'that is playing an extra spinner or not,” he said. With '
            'off-spinning all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin announcing his '
            'immediate retirement from international cricket after the third '
            'Test in Brisbane, Ravindra Jadeja is expected to keep his place. '
            'Washington Sundar is the other spin option. India has been '
            'carried this series by pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who has '
            'tormented Australia almost single-handedly, with the other quicks '
            'not offering as much menace. Speedster Akash Deep replaced the '
            'underperforming Harshit Rana in Brisbane and is set to play again '
            'along with Mohammed Siraj and Nitish Kumar Reddy should the '
            'second spin option not be taken. Teenager Sam Konstas will make '
            'his Test debut in the cauldron of the Boxing Day Test, coach '
            'Andrew McDonald said on Tuesday. Konstas, 19, was brought into '
            'the squad at the expense of Nathan McSweeney after Australia’s '
            'top order struggled for runs in the first three Tests of the '
            'series. “He’s composed, relaxed, knows his game is in a good '
            'place at the moment, he’ll play Boxing Day,” McDonald told '
            'reporters at the MCG. “We said from the get-go that age was no '
            'barrier. And what he’s shown is an array of shots, the ability to '
            'put pressure back onto opponents and he gets his opportunity. '
            '“We’re really excited for him, Boxing Day, the biggest stage. He '
            'might as well get that one out of the way early.” With bowlers, '
            'particularly Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, having had the '
            'upper hand in the series so far, McDonald said switching '
            'McSweeney for Konstas was a tactical move. “We want to throw a '
            'different challenge at India at this point in time,” he said. “We '
            'believe Nathan is good enough for Test level. We weren’t sure '
            'about how the top order was functioning. We challenged ourselves '
            'for that decision. Whether it works or not, time will tell (but) '
            'we’re really confident that Sam can do the job.” McDonald was '
            'also confident Travis Head, who has scored 409 runs with two '
            'centuries in the first three Tests, would be fit to play despite '
            'a quad strain preventing him from training on Monday. “Has he got '

 'content': 'LONDON: Christmas Premier League chart-toppers Liverpool are '
            'overwhelming favourites to see off struggling Leicester City on '
            'Boxing Day (Thursday). Meanwhile both crisis-hit Manchester clubs '
            'will seek a festive fillip, with faltering champions City at home '
            'to Everton and United away to Wolverhampton Wanderers. '
            'Second-placed Chelsea host Fulham while in-form Arsenal will '
            'fancy their chances against relegation-threatened Ipswich Town on '
            'Friday, even without the injured Bukayo Saka. Ange Postecoglou’s '
            'Tottenham Hotspur, licking their wounds after a brutal 6-3 '
            'hammering by Liverpool, face a tough assignment at high-flying '
            'Nottingham Forest. Liverpool are top the table on Christmas Day '
            'for the first time since the 2020/21 season and will want to make '
            'it count. Just once in the past seven top-flight campaigns in '
            'which they have sat at the summit on Dec 25, have they gone on to '
            'win the title. Arne Slot’s side returned to winning ways in style '
            'on Sunday, overwhelming Spurs following two frustrating draws. '
            'They are four points clear of Chelsea with a game in hand. It '
            'would be a huge surprise if they slipped up against Leicester at '
            'home, especially with Mohamed Salah enjoying a purple patch. The '
            'Egypt international is the first player to reach double figures '
            'for both goals (15) and assists (11) before Christmas in the '
            'history of the Premier League. Leicester won their first match '
            'under new manager Ruud van Nistelrooy earlier this month but have '
            'collected just a single point in their past three matches, '
            'conceding nine goals. The leaky Foxes have not won at Anfield '
            'since 2000 and are just two points clear of the drop zone after '
            'returning to the top flight this season. Title contenders Chelsea '
            'manager Enzo Meresca was still adamant that his side are not '
            'genuine challengers for the crown. “We are ahead of our '
            'expectations, in terms of the way we are playing,  and the points '
            'we have, but the main focus is how we can improve the  players '
            'and how we can improve the team.” Maresca, who has repeatedly  '
            'dismissed any title talk concerning Che\xadl\xadsea, added:  “It '
            'is not about  the (title) pressure for the players or for the '
            'club or for me, it is  just the reality. “I would like to have '
            'that kind of pressure and hopefully soon we  can, but the reason '
            'why I said we are not there yet, is because the  reality is that '
            'we are not.” Arsenal will play at home and a buoyant Mikel Arteta '
            'said the Premier League title race was  “on” after Arsenal swept '
            'Crystal Palace aside 5-1 on Saturday. But one dark cloud was Saka '
            'limping off at Selhurst Park, with the England winger set for a '
            'lengthy spell on the sidelines with a hamstring injury. It is a '
            'blow for Arteta, depriving him of his most potent attacking '
            'weapon — Saka has scored nine goals and provided 13 assists in '
            'all competitions this season — just as Arsenal are finding their '
            'form again. “It’s going to be a really good exercise for all of '
            'us to think about ways to overcome another challenge, because '
            'we’ve already had a lot in the season,” said Arsenal boss Arteta, '
            'whose team are third in the Premier League table. Arteta has a '
            'number of attacking options, with Gabriel Martinelli a candidate '
            'to fill the void, but Saka, 23, offers something unique. Another '
            'Champions League hopefuls Nottingham Forest fans are dreaming of '
            'a return to the European top tier competition — more than 40 '
            'years after they last played. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have won '
            'seven of their past 10 Premier League games to climb to fourth in '
            'the table ahead of their match against Tottenham on Thursday. '
            'Forest have not won a major trophy since 1990 but they have a '
            'proud tradition in continental competition — with the Midlands '
            'club twice crowned European champions under former manager Brian '
            'Clough, in 1979 and 1980. While Forest are not prolific scorers, '
            'they are impressive at the back — only Liverpool and Arsenal have '
            'conceded fewer goals in the English top flight this season. '
            'Former Spurs boss Nuno is braced for the unknown against his '
            'former club, who have built a reputation as great entertainers. '
            '“You never know what’s going to happen in the game,” he said.  '
            '“What we can see is good players, a lot of goals, also conceding '
            'goals.” Fixtures Thursday (1500 GMT unless stated): Manchester '

            'October, Pakistan will don their Test whites again when they take '
            'on South Africa at the SuperSport Park in the first fixture of '
            'the two-match Test series on Thursday. Pakistan’s exploits '
            'against England — their only victories in the ongoing World Test '
            'Championship cycle — however, came too late for the South Africa '
            'series to hold any title-challenging meaning for the Shan '
            'Masood-led side. For South Africa, on the other hand, winning the '
            'opening match would seal their place in the WTC final. Making it '
            'difficult for Temba Bavuma’s side will be Pakistan’s way of '
            'maintaining the pride they had lately regained in the format. “We '
            'are eagerly looking forward to measure ourselves against South '
            'Africa, who have always been one of the top sides in the world,” '
            'Shan said in a statement on Wednesday. “We have got some momentum '
            'from the recently concluded home Test series against England and '
            'the ODI series which featured a number of our Test squad '
            'members.” Pakistan had gotten the better of England by employing '
            'spin-friendly conditions at home and unleashing spinners Sajid '
            'Khan and Noman Ali in the last two Tests to take their first Test '
            'series win at home in four years. South Africa would be a whole '
            'different atmosphere, with the country’s pace-conducive surfaces '
            'requiring Pakistan to discover their winning formula away from '
            'home. So far, Shan and interim head coach and selection committee '
            'member Aaqib Javed have decided to place their bets on the '
            'seasoned performers of the domestic first-class circuit in '
            'Khurram Shehzad and more importantly Mohammad Abbas — who returns '
            'to the Test side for the first time since 2021. However, pace '
            'sensation Naseem Shah will be spearheading the Pakistan attack in '
            'the first Test, with his partner and the team’s mainstay Shaheen '
            'Shah Afridi has been rested to save him from possible fatigue '
            'ahead of next year’s Champions Trophy. For Shan, Abbas, given the '
            'conditions fitted to the side easily. “… Abbas’s skillset is a '
            'valuable addition now, as we needed someone with his consistency '
            'and control,” the captain told reporters on Wednesday. “He fits '
            'perfectly in a Test attack and, ideally, should have a role in '
            'the line-up. “… as we look ahead to South Africa, we need a '
            'bowler who can bowl many overs, provide control, and bring '
            'something different to the table.” According to Shan’s '
            'examination, the pitch at the SuperSport Park seemed to be '
            'conducive for seam bowling, and he believed the ground was such '
            'that the scoring shots had a lot of value. “It’s a high field, so '
            'we need to consider both batting and seam bowling elements in the '
            'line-up,” he noted. “I think there’s nothing drastically '
            'different between the two teams in terms of the strategy or '
            'strength they will rely on. It’s more about the conditions.” The '
            'three-pronged Pakistan pace attack will have the support of Aamer '
            'Jamal as a bowling all-rounder who adds balance to a line-up in '
            'conditions like those in Centurion. Aamer, on his debut tour in '
            'Australia last year, took 18 wickets in three matches and showed '
            'ability with the bat as well, more than proving his place in the '
            'national Test side and Shan backed the right-armer for Thursday’s '
            'Test. “He’s a multi-dimensional bowler, both for reverse swing '
            'and for situations requiring a little more force,” Shan said of '
            'Aamer. “His batting has also impressed everyone.” “The number '
            'eight slot is crucial in Test matches, and if you look at the '
            'best teams, they often have all-rounders at that position, which '
            'helps maintain a balance in the side and allows space for '
            'specialist bowlers.” Pakistan and South Africa have played each '
            'other in 12 Test series since 1995, out of which seven have been '
            'won by South Africa while Pakistan emerged victorious in two, '
            'while three ended-up as draws. In the recent most Test series '
            'between the two nations, Pakistan beat South Africa 2-0 at home '
            'in Jan-Feb 2021. Pakistan, however, haven’t won a Test in South '
            'Africa for the last 18 years. But their confidence level is on a '
            'high as they come into the Test series after whitewashing South '
            'Africa in the preceding One-day International series. South '
            'Africa captain Temba Bavuma said his players would have to deal '
            'with the mental pressure given what was at stake. “Whether it’s '
            'easy, whether it’s hard, we’ve got to find a way to do it,” he '
            'said. “Whatever, I don’t know, trauma that was there, you know, '

 'content': 'MELBOURNE: Australia’s top four all slammed 50 or better on '
            'Thursday to take a firm grip on day one of the fourth Test '
            'against India, with fearless teenage ope\xadn\xader Sam Konstas '
            'stealing the show. Batting after captain Pat Cummins won the toss '
            'on a steamy day, the hosts reached 311-6 by the close in front of '
            'more than 87,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. They were '
            'aided by some inconsistent early bowling and a flying start from '
            'Konstas. The 19-year-old blasted a hugely entertaining 60 off 65 '
            'balls in a debut to remember, pounding 18 off one Jasprit Bumrah '
            'over and having a run-in with superstar Virat Kohli. At the '
            'close, Steve Smith was not out 68 and Pat Cummins was eight. '
            'Marnus Labuschagne made 72 and Usman Khawaja 57. All the bowlers '
            'were punished but they rallied with four wickets in the final '
            'session, including dangerman Travis Head for a duck, to haul '
            'themselves back into the contest. Bumrah led the charge, ending '
            'with 3-75. “It was quite surreal with the big crowd, the biggest '
            'crowd I’ve ever played before,” said Konstas. “I just played with '
            'freedom and backed myself. Lucky to get a few runs. A bit '
            'disappointed with the way I got out but hopefully we have got a '
            'bit of momentum for tomorrow.” The five-match series is locked at '
            '1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by '
            '10 wickets in Adelaide. The rain-affected third Test in Brisbane '
            'was drawn. “A lot of credit to the way Sam played. The intent he '
            'showed sort of put us on the back foot,” said Indian batting '
            'coach Abhishek Nayar. “But it took a lot of character for our '
            'bowlers to stick in there. It wasn’t the easiest conditions to '
            'bowl. At times like that it is important to stick to your plans '
            'and post-lunch we came back really strong.” With Konstas in for '
            'the axed Nathan McSweeney, he and Khawaja shared an 89-run '
            'opening partnership — the hosts’ best of the series — before the '
            'teenager was undone by the spin of Ravindra Jadeja. Australia’s '
            'youngest-ever opener faced the first over from a menacing Bumrah '
            'and survived despite the Indian spearhead repeatedly beating his '
            'bat. Konstas said before the match he had a plan to combat '
            'Bumrah, and as he got his eye in he incredibly reverse ramped him '
            'for two fours and a six in one over, bringing the crowd alive. '
            'Konstas slammed 18 off the next Bumrah over, including another '
            'six. His half-century came off just 52 balls — the third-fastest '
            'on debut for Australia. At the other end Khawaja, twice the age '
            'of his opening partner, was content to be the support act, '
            'grinding his way to a 27th Test 50 in a welcome return to form. '
            'Bumrah finally removed him after a 121-ball stay with Khawaja’s '
            'pull shot going only as far as KL Rahul at midwicket, leaving '
            'Labuschagne and Smith to see them to tea. Smith survived three '
            'lbw appeals from Akash Deep when they returned before India '
            'finally earned a reward when spinner Washington Sundar, in the '
            'side for Shubman Gill, tempted Labuschagne into a drive that was '
            'collected by Kohli. The dangerous Head marched to the crease '
            'after plundering centuries in both Adelaide and Brisbane but only '
            'lasted seven balls. Bumrah did the damage, with the Australian '
            'leaving a delivery that clattered into his off stump, before the '
            'Indian star accounted for Mitchell Marsh (4) and Alex Carey (31) '

            'deliberately bumping shoulders with young Australian batsman Sam '
            'Konstas in the fourth Test on Thursday. The Indian veteran made '
            'forceful contact with the 19-year-old debutant after Konstas '
            'belted the bowlers around the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It '
            'sparked a heated exchange between the pair in the first session, '
            'with Konstas’ fellow opener Usman Khawaja and umpire Michael '
            'Gough intervening. The International Cricket Council (ICC) '
            'announced on Thursday that Kohli  “has been fined 20 percent of '
            'his match fee and awarded one demerit point for breaching Level 1 '
            'of the ICC Code of Conduct”. The code relates to  “inappropriate '
            'physical contact with a player, player support personnel, umpire, '
            'match referee or any other person including a spectator during an '
            'international match,” the ICC said in a statement. “No formal '
            'hearing was needed as Kohli accepted the sanctions proposed by '
            'match referee Andy Pycroft,” it added. Kohli, who is considered '
            'one of the best batters of this generation, was criticised by '
            'many for his on-field actions. “Virat walked one whole pitch over '
            'to his right and instigated that confrontation,” Ricky Ponting '
            'said on Australia’s Channel Seven.  “No doubt in my mind '
            'whatsoever. “I have no doubt that the umpires and the referee '
            'will have a good look at that.” Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri '
            'called Kohli’s actions  “absolutely unnecessary”. “Virat’s a '
            'senior player, he’s been captain... he’ll have his own '
            'explanations with regards to that, but it’s one thing you don’t '
            'want to see,” he said on Fox Sports. “One person who will be '
            'watching, his eyes locked into the proceedings, is [match '
            'referee] Andy Pycroft.” Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan, also '
            'on commentary duties in Australia, said Kohli  “completely acted '
            'wrong”. “I don’t know why a senior pro who’s played for so '
            'long... why’s he’s been rattled by a 19-year-old. Sam Konstas did '
            'absolutely nothing wrong there,” he added. Konstas, called into '
            'the side after Nathan McSweeney was axed, played down the '
            'incident in a post-match news conference. “I was just doing my '
            'gloves and I think he accidentally bumped me. But that’s just '
            'cricket, the tension,” said the teenager, Australia’s '
            'youngest-ever opener.',

            'cricket, dismissing Pakistan captain Shan Masood in the 14th '

            'drafted into the South Africa side after a raft of injuries to '
            'their regular fast bowlers, had     Shan (17) caught at third '

            'approach from his players after they beat South Africa 3-0 in a '
            'one-day series which ended on Sunday.   He reasoned that it was '
            'the sort of pitch on which positive stroke play was required to '
            'score runs in seam-friendly conditions.    It seemed the majority '
            'of Pakistan’s batsmen were still in aggressive one-day mode. Both '
            'Paterson and Bosch benefitted from batsmen playing poor '
            'strokes.   “When we saw them really coming at us we just said, be '
            'patient,” said Bosch. “There was enough in the wicket that if you '

            'out. It was [about] holding our nerve and not backing down.”   '
            'Saud Shakeel played an extraordinary innings after going out to '
            'bat with his side on 41 for three, hitting three boundaries off '

            'leg-side for 14 off six balls off a sharp short pitch ball after '
            'South Africa successfully went for a television review.    Kamran '
            'was undeterred, racing to a 52-ball half-century and sharing a '
            'rapid 81-run fifth-wicket stand with Mohammad Rizwan (27).   '
            'Kamran went for his shots, sometimes to the frustration of the '
            'South African bowlers, and his feisty effort included an exchange '
            'of words with Kagiso Rabada — South Africa’s most impressive '
            'bowler despite not taking a wicket — and wicket-keeper Kyle '
            'Verreynne.    “I just focus on playing positive cricket,” Kamran '
            'told reporters after the day’s play. “The wicket was quite '
            'challenging, especially in the first session, but we managed. '
            'When I was batting with Rizwan, we were both playing really well, '
            'and everything seemed in control.”  Paterson ended the promising '
            'stand, dismissing Kamran, who came down the wicket to the bowler, '
            'was cramped up by a short ball and top edged high into the sky to '
            'be caught by Rabada.    Paterson then dismissed Rizwan and '
            'brought up his five wicket haul by dismissing Salman Ali Agha.    '
            'Aamer Jamal (28) was twice dropped by Stubbs in the slips before '
            'Pakistan lost three wickets without a run and crumbled to 189-9. '
            'Bosch was on a hat trick when Aamer played the fast bowler back '
            'onto his stumps and Naseem Shah offered a tame catch at '
            'mid-on.    Abbas survived the hat-trick ball before Pakistan were '
            'bowled out early in the last session.    Khurram hit the top of '
            'De Zorzi’s middle stump with a delivery that jagged back into the '
            'left-hander and wicket-keeper Rizwan took a splendid low catch to '
            'dismiss Rickelton with fast bowlers making full use of conducive '
            'conditions throughout the day.    Abbas then baffled Stubbs with '
            'a nippy delivery and had him trapped leg before wicket before '

 'content': 'LONDON: Liverpool boss Arne Slot said it was “too early” to say '
            'his side were on course for the Premier League title after they '
            'secured a 3-1 comeback win over Leicester City to move seven '
            'points clear at the top of the table. Leicester took a shock '
            'sixth-minute lead through Jordan Ayew on Thursday but goals from '
            'Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah turned the tide at '
            'Anfield. Liverpool are now firm title favourites with the victory '
            'extending their unbeaten league run to 13 games and putting them '
            'on 42 points from 17 games, seven points clear of second-placed '
            'Chelsea with a game in hand. But Dutch manager Slot, in his first '
            'season in charge since succeeding Jurgen Klopp, remains cautious '
            'about the prospect of bringing the Premier League title to '
            'Anfield for the first time since 2020. “If you are in this game '
            'for a long time like the players and I am, then 20 games before '
            'the end you don’t look at it as there are so many challenges '
            'ahead of you,” he said. “Injuries and a bit of bad luck can '
            'happen to any team, it is far too early to be already celebrating '
            '— but it is nice for us to be where we are. We have to take it '
            'one game at a time. The league table is something of course we '
            'are aware of but we always understand how many games there are to '
            'go.” Salah, who leads the league with 16 goals, said he senses '
            'something different about the way the club are performing as '
            'leaders this season, having faltered before from similar '
            'positions, most notably in the 2018/19 season when they had a '
            'sizeable lead but eventually finished behind Manchester City. “It '
            'feels different but the important thing is we need to stay '
            'humble,” Salah told  . “We had a few injuries when we were ahead '
            '[previously] and we lose it in the end. Hopefully we carry on '
            'like that with no injuries and we go on and win it. This one is '
            'very special. Hopefully we win the Premier League for this club — '
            'it’s something I dream of.” Liverpool suffered an early shock at '
            'a foggy Anfield in the last of the Boxing Day kickoffs with Ayew '
            'giving Leicester a lead in the sixth minute. Leicester hung on '
            'until the stroke of halftime but just after Salah struck the '
            'crossbar, Gak\xadpo curled an effort beyond Leic\xade\xadster '
            'goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk. Liverpool put Leicester un\xadder '
            'siege straight from the break and took just four minutes into the '
            'second half Jones converted a pass by Alexis Mac Allister. Salah '
            'then grabbed his 19th goal this term with a trademark finish to '
            'wrap up Liverpool’s 11th win in their last 13 games in all '
            'competitions. “We cannot deny we are in a good place, but still '
            'one of the strengths of the team is we approach each game as a '
            'new one,” Gakpo said. “That keeps us humble.” Earlier, Manchester '
            'United suffered a third successive loss in all competitions to '
            'leave new boss Ruben Amorim with five defeats in his first 10 '
            'games, going down 2-0 at Wolverh\xadampton Wanderers to sit in '
            '14th place. Amorim left Marcus Rash\xadford out of his fourth '
            'successive squad and his side were undermined at Wolves as '
            'captain Bruno Fernandes was sent off just after halftime at '
            'Molineux for a second yellow card. United’s 10 men cracked in the '
            '58th minute when Matheus Cunha’s corner went straight in as '
            'goalkeeper Andre Onana flapped under pressure. Hwang Hee-chan '
            'compoun\xadded Amorim’s misery when he tapped in with just '
            'seconds left. Losing to fourth-bottom Wolves was another bitter '
            'blow for United, who endured a humiliating 3-0 defeat by '
            'Bournemouth at Old Trafford last weekend after losing 4-3 in the '
            'League Cup at Tottenham. With his team on 22 points — just eight '
            'points above the relegation zone, Amorim’s woes mig\xadht not be '
            'over with United facing in-form Newcastle United on Monday before '
            'travelling to Liverpool in their first game of 2025. “We have to '
            'work on a lot of things in our club, inside the pitch and outside '
            'of the pitch, in each game and use every minute of training and '
            'game to imp\xadr\xadove,” Amorim said, adding he had “no idea” '
            'how long it would take to turn things around“. “I have to just '
            'take it day by day, try and see the videos, using every minute of '
            'training to try and [help] us win some points. The idea needs '
            'time. I said it before to you guys that this will be a tough '
            'moment and we are far from the end of this moment and that’s it.” '
            'Things are very different for Amorim’s compatriot Vitor Pereira, '
            'with the new Wolves boss continuing his perfect start since '
            'succeeding the sacked Gary O’Neil following a commanding 3-0 win '
            'at Leicester as his side moved out of the relegation zone. '
            '“Fantastic feeling,” said Per\xade\xadira after his first home '
            'match in charge. “Special because of the spirit of the team. Now '
            'I think we can see that the players are ready to suffer '
            'together.”',

 'content': 'SYDNEY: Two experienced sailors were killed in separate incidents '
            'in the treacherous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, organisers and '
            'local authorities said on Friday, as a string of yachts retired '
            'in powerful winds and high seas. Race organisers had said in a '
            'statement that both crew members died after they were suspected '
            'to have been hit by the sail boom, a horizontal pole which holds '
            'down the sails and swings depending on the direction of the wind. '
            'They later said one of the sailors, Nick Smith from South '
            'Australia, has been hit by the boat’s mainsheet and thrown across '
            'the boat, hitting his head on the winch. Smith, 65, was a crew '
            'member of the Bowline, competing in the race for the fifth time. '
            'A few hours later a crew member on the Flying Fish Arctos was '
            'struck by a sail boom and died. He was identified as Roy Quaden, '
            '55, a sailor with two decades of experience from Western '
            'Australia. “The sailing community is a very close community, and '
            'there’s about a thousand sailors on the water in this race and to '
            'lose two in this fashion is just devastating,” said David Jacobs, '
            'vice commodore at Cruising Yacht Club of Australia. “We always '
            'want to improve safety wherever we can. So we will do an '
            'investigation and if there’s something that boats can do to try '
            'and prevent this happening, we will implement it.” Other crew '
            'tried to revive the two Australians but were unsuccessful. '
            'Weather conditions played a part in the deaths, Jacobs told '
            'reporters, with one of the boats facing 30-38 knot winds and seas '
            'of two-to-three metres (six-10 feet). “They’re challenging '
            'conditions. You only need to be hit broadside by a wave and it '
            'will knock you across,” Jacobs said, adding however that the '
            'weather was not “extreme” for ocean racers. In a night of drama, '
            'one man was also swept overboard from the yacht Porco Rosso and '
            'carried far out before being rescued by his crew, Jacobs said. He '
            'promised an investigation by the yacht club to help improve '
            'safety in the event but said the race would go on. Crews on the '
            'two yachts that lost men had been hard hit, said New South Wales '
            'marine area command superintendent Joseph McNulty. “Both those '
            'crews are doing it pretty tough at the moment. They are shaken up '
            'by what they’ve seen and what they’ve had to do,” he told '
            'reporters. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was '
            '“heartbreaking that two lives have been lost at what should have '
            'been a time of joy”. The last loss of life in the race came in '
            '1998 when five yachts were sunk and six sailors died after a '
            'major storm hit the fleet. So far 21 yachts — including race '
            'record holder Comanche — have pulled out from the fleet of 104 '
            'that left Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day bound for the Tasmanian '
            'capital, organisers said. Many were dismasted or suffered damage '
            'to mainsails and other equipment. Comanche’s retirement with a '
            'damaged mainsail overnight left the door open for supermaxi rival '
            'LawConnect to win line honours for the second straight year. '

 'content': 'MELBOURNE: Australia’s fiery pace attack destroyed India’s top '
            'order on Friday to put them in the driving seat of the fourth '
            'Test after they set a daunting first innings target on the back '
            'of Steve Smith’s 34th Test century. The visitors were 164-5 at '
            'the close on day two at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, still 310 '
            'runs adrift after Australia was out for 474 soon after lunch, '
            'buoyed by Smith’s stylish 140. Rishabh Pant was not out six and '
            'Ravindra Jadeja on four, with three wickets in the final '
            'half-hour bursting India’s momentum after they were 153-2. Scott '
            'Boland and skipper Pat Cummins grabbed two wickets each. “Smithy '
            'was awesome this morning. He felt so composed and took the game '
            'on when he was on top of them,” Cummins told  . “And then to get '
            'a couple of late wickets really sets up the rest of the game.” '
            'Skipper Rohit Sharma reverted to his usual role as opener after '
            'dropping to six in the past two Tests. But it did nothing to help '
            'his woeful recent form and he was out for three, spooning an '
            'attempted pull shot off Cummins to Boland at mid-on for a simple '
            'catch. Cummins pounced again to remove the in-form KL Rahul with '
            'the last ball before tea, bowling him for 24. But opener Yashasvi '
            'Jaiswal stood firm with a high-quality innings, crunching a '
            'series of stylish boundaries in his 82. The 22-year-old, who '
            'scored 161 in the first Test at Perth, looked destined for '
            'another century but threw his wicket away in a comical mix up '
            'with Virat Kohli. Jaiswal set off for a quick single off Boland '
            'but his teammate said no, leaving the youngster stranded, ending '
            'a dangerous 102-run stand. Kohli, who was fined 20 per cent of '
            'his match fee for a day one shoulder charge on Australian '
            'debutant Sam Konstas, was caught behind by Alex Carey for 36 off '
            'Boland, who then removed night-watchman Akash Deep without '
            'scoring. “We looked like we were in a great position to get big '
            'runs, especially when Yashasvi was batting,” said Indian spinner '
            'Washington Sundar. “But we’ll come back and continue to fight '
            'tomorrow morning. The energy is very good in the dressing room. '
            'We are all positive. There’s still three days and a lot of overs '
            'to play.” The hosts resumed on 311-6 after a dominant opening day '
            'and plundered another 163 runs, with the composed Smith slamming '
            '13 fours and three sixes. Smith padded up again on 68, with '
            'Cummins alongside him on eight. They took 15 off one Deep over '
            'before Smith hooked Jasprit Bumrah for six to rub salt in the '
            'wounds, with India’s body language showing their frustration. '
            'Smith reached his 34th Test century with a boundary off Nitish '
            'Kumar Reddy, which came on the back of a return to form in the '
            'last Test in Brisbane where he made 101. It was a patient innings '
            'from the 35-year-old and moved him alongside four other players '
            'on the all-time list of century-makers, including Sunil Gavaskar '
            'and Brian Lara. Only six men have scored more, led by Sachin '
            'Tendulkar’s 51. With the landmark out of the way, both men began '
            'swinging the bat and Cummins paid the price, caught for a fine 49 '
            'by Reddy in the deep off Jadeja to end a 112-run stand. Starc was '
            'bowled by Jadeja for 15 in the first over after lunch, with Smith '
            'following in bizarre fashion. Facing Deep, he danced down the '
            'wicket looking to drive but got an inside edge, with the ball '
            'bouncing off his pads and trickling onto leg stump. Nathan Lyon '
            '(13) was the final wicket to fall, lbw to Bumrah who ended with '

 'content': 'LONDON: Declan Rice is hoping 2025 brings silverware for Arsenal '
            'but knows they need some help to deny a rampant Liverpool the '
            'Premier League title.  The Gunners moved second in the table '
            'after a largely trouble-free, if slightly pedestrian, 1-0 win at '
            'home to struggling Ipswich Town on a chilly night in north London '
            'on Friday but remain six points behind Liverpool, who also have a '
            'game in hand.  Arsenal finished second to Manchester City in each '
            'of the previous two seasons and Rice wants to end their status as '
            'nearly men in the new year.  “Hopefully the new year brings '
            'trophies — we’ve been pushing for that. To make the next step to '
            'be amongst the elite, you have to win stuff,” the England '
            'midfielder told Amazon Prime.  “We can keep winning games but it '
            'means nothing if you don’t win nothing. Liverpool are full '
            'throttle, they were under [Jurgen] Klopp and now under [Arne] '
            'Slot. They don’t let anyone breathe. We need someone to help us '
            'out so they can drop points as we can only focus on ourselves and '
            'hopefully something can happen.”  Arsenal’s chances of chasing '
            'down a Liverpool side that have lost just once in 17 Premier '
            'League games under Slot has not been helped by a serious '
            'hamstring injury suffered by Bukayo Saka.  Saka is set to be '
            'sidelined for “many weeks” in the words of Gunners’ boss Mikel '
            'Arteta with fears the England international could be out until '
            'March due to a hamstring injury suffered in last weekend’s 5-1 '
            'victory at Crystal Palace.  The lack of a clinical goalscorer may '
            'ultimately cost Mikel Arteta’s men a first league title in more '
            'than 20 years, but they took advantage of Chelsea’s shock 2-1 '
            'defeat against Fulham on Thursday to become Liverpool’s closest '
            'challenger.  A first-half goal from Kai Havertz, who pounced on a '
            'smart pull-back from Leandro Trossard, proved the winner although '
            'the hosts should have scored more as the Gunners’ performance '
            'failed to provide many pre-New Year fireworks.  “Frustration when '
            'you win? No. Things to improve? Yes,” said Arteta on the slender '
            'margin of victory. “Credit to them as they’re very well '
            'organised, but we restricted them to nothing. We should have '
            'scored more but it is the consistency, the team conceded nothing '
            'again.  “Considering all the circumstances we had this season, '
            'the amount of times we had to play with 10 men, all the injuries '
            'that we had, it’s good to be in the position that we are but it’s '
            'not where we want to be. We want to be first.”  Lacking the '
            'creativity of the injured Saka, it took 19 minutes before Arsenal '
            'mustered their first shot although four minutes after that '
            'Havertz netted his sixth of the season in all competitions by '
            'tapping in Trossard’s whipped cross.  Ipswich had a spell of '
            'pressure after 10 minutes of the second half but it proved '
            'fleeting and Arsenal should have comfortably put the game to bed '
            'after that.  Defender Gabriel Magalhaes missed a golden '
            'opportunity to extend his run of scoring from corners when he '
            'headed just wide when completely unmarked. Captain Martin '
            'Odegaard then blazed over after he danced from midfield into the '
            'visitors box.  The win lifted Arsenal to 36 points behind '
            'Liverpool, who have 42 and a game in hand, and meant the Gunners '
            'leapfrogged both London rivals Chelsea, who have 35 points, and '
            'one of the season’s surprise packages Nottingham Forest, fourth '
            'on 34.  Ipswich remain second-bottom with 12 points from 18 '
            'games, three off the safety zone, before they host Chelsea on '
            'Monday.  “The players worked really hard and we got the game to a '
            'good place in the second half after a good 20 minutes,” Ipswich '
            'manager Kieran McKenna told the BBC. “Early on we were pinned in '
            'and couldn’t get out but to be where we were after 89 minutes I '
            'was really pleased ... Some defending was good and we’ll need '
            'that on Monday against Chelsea.”  Brighton & Hove Albion missed '
            'the chance to move within one point of the top five as their poor '
            'run continued in a 0-0 draw at home to Brentford.  Fabian '
            'Hurzeler’s Seagulls are now winless in their past six games and '
            'are 10th in the table with 26 points after 18 games, two points '
            'ahead of 11th-placed Brentford who are still without an away '
            'victory this season.  Hurzeler rued the two points lost after '
            'seeing his side dominate the clash but lacking a finishing touch '
            'despite having 24 shots at a misty American Express Stadium.  '
            '“It’s a disappointing feeling. In the locker room it’s not a '
            'great atmosphere,” he said. “But in the end it’s our '
            'responsibility, we have to learn to win these games. In the end '
            'it’s a business where you need to get results, we need to learn '
            'how to win these games.”',

 'content': 'MELBOURNE: In a Boxing Day clash energised by next-gen talent, '
            'India’s rookie all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy celebrated a '
            'stirring, maiden century on Saturday to give the visitors hope of '
            'saving the fourth Test against Australia.  The 21-year-old sent '
            'Indian fans into delirium as he strode forward to thump Scott '
            'Boland over mid-on for four to raise his hundred late on the '
            'third day, bringing tears to the eyes of his overjoyed father in '
            'the Melbourne Cricket Ground crowd.  Reddy strode off unbeaten on '
            '105 when bad light and rain brought stumps an hour early, with '
            'India 358 for nine, still trailing Australia’s first innings 474 '
            'by 116 runs.  Taking full advantage of a docile wicket, Reddy '
            'built a vital 127-run partnership for the eight wicket with '
            'Washington Sundar (50) that dragged India back from the brink.  '
            'India were 221 for seven when they came together, still 54 runs '
            'short of avoiding the follow-on.  The tourists still have hard '
            'yards ahead to deny Australia victory and a 2-1 lead in the '
            'five-Test series, with Sydney hosting the final match in the New '
            'Year.  But the players were buoyed by Reddy’s composure '
            'throughout his unbeaten, 176-ball knock.  “One thing for sure, '
            'his mentality is very, very strong,” Sundar told reporters. “I’ve '
            'known him for quite a few years. The way he went about his '
            'business today was amazing. He gives a hundred percent, that’s '
            'his approach to life. I’m sure this hundred will be talked about '
            'and remembered for a very, very long time.”  Reddy will return on '
            'day four hoping to grab a few more runs with tailender Mohammed '
            'Siraj, who was two not out.  Siraj enjoyed one of the day’s '
            'biggest cheers when he blocked out Australia’s paceman-captain '
            'Pat Cummins for three balls to allow Reddy, who was stranded at '
            'the non-striker’s end on 99, to complete his ton in the next '
            'over.  In just his fourth test, Reddy celebrated his hundred by '
            'planting his bat in the turf, putting his helmet over the handle '
            'and saluting the sky as a huge crowd of 83,073 gave him a '
            'standing ovation.  The MCG crowds have now seen two young talents '
            'make their mark this Test, with Australia’s 19-year-old opener '
            'Sam Konstas producing a thrilling knock of 60 on day one of his '
            'debut.  Seamers Boland, who took 3-57, and Cummins with 3-86 were '
            'the most productive Australian bowlers in conditions that offered '
            'little assistance despite overcast skies.  Boland said Reddy was '
            'a “nice player” whose range of shots proved hard to contain.  “It '
            'looks like he’s got pretty much every shot in the book,” Boland '
            'said. “Obviously he’s playing really nicely. Coming in down in '
            'the lower order, he’s trying to put the pressure back on us.”  '
            'Boland said team-mate Mitchell Starc was bowling with a “niggle '
            'in his back or rib” but expected the paceman would continue to '
            'play a full part in the Test. “He’s someone who can still bowl at '
            'the same pace even when he is really sore, which is a great trait '
            'to have.”  India lost Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja in the '
            'opening session.  Pant’s innings of 28 ended when he '
            'over-balanced while attempting a ramp shot for six off Boland, '
            'top-edging the ball to third man where off-spinner Nathan Lyon '
            'held the catch.  Jadeja was trapped lbw when on 17, playing back '
            'to a Lyon delivery that skidded on.  Reddy resurrected India with '
            'an innings laden with attractive shots and meaty slogging.  He '
            'raised his first test fifty with a lofted square drive, '
            'despatching a loose Starc delivery to the ropes for four.  He '
            'later brought up the 100-partnership with Sundar with a sumptuous '
            'cover drive, made all the more sweet for Indian fans when Lyon '
            'stumbled at the boundary to concede a four.  The recalled '
            'Sundar’s dogged knock off 162 balls ended when he was caught at '
            'first slip by Steve Smith from Lyon.  It ended a partnership that '
            'traversed the entire second session after India had advanced from '
            '164-5 overnight to 244-7 at lunch.  Boland was confident '
            'Australia could bat India out of the game after dominating the '
            'opening days. “We’re in a pretty strong position. Obviously it '

            'to an early close on a rain-delayed third day, still 121 runs shy '
            'of victory in the   against Pakistan at Centurion. The home side '
            'is chasing a modest target of 148 after bowling out Pakistan for '
            '237. However, Pakistan kept their own hopes of victory alive as '
            'they took three wickets in the opening nine overs of South '
            'Africa’s second innings, with Mohammad Abbas taking two wickets '
            'and Khurram Shahzad the third, as Tony de Zorzi (2), Ryan '
            'Rickleton (0) and Tristan Stubbs (1) were all trapped leg before '

            'innings, will resume on 22 not out, alongside skipper Temba '
            'Bavuma, when play resumes on Sunday. South Africa fast bowler '
            'Marco Jansen helped put the brakes on Pakistan’s attempted '
            'fightback earlier in the day as the tourists were 212 runs for '
            'eight wickets at tea, with only a slim 122-run lead. Saud Shakeel '
            'top scored with 84, before being undone by a full toss from '
            'Jansen, but his dismissal was unlucky in contrast to a raft of '
            'injudicious shots that saw his teammates get out. Jansen took '
            'three wickets in four overs to complete a five-wicket haul while '
            'Dane Paterson and Kagiso Rabada grabbed a wicket each on Saturday '
            'to hand the hosts the advantage after Pakistan had made a '
            'positive start to the day’s play. Shakeel and Babar Azam both '
            'scored fifties to overturn a two-run deficit at the start of '
            'play, which was delayed until after lunch because of a passing '
            'rainstorm. Babar scored his first fifty in his last 20 Test '
            'innings in a much-needed return to form, while Shakeel continued '
            'where he left off from their last Test against England as '
            'Pakistan overhauled South Africa’s   and looked to set their '
            'hosts a testing target. They were 153-3 and beginning to unnerve '
            'their hosts before a raft of injudicious shots saw them lose '
            'wickets and momentum. Babar had moved briskly from 16 not out '
            'overnight to 50 but was then tempted into swinging at a short and '
            'wide delivery in Jansen’s first over and caught by Corbin Bosch '
            'on the boundary. Mohammad Rizwan then also gave away his wicket '
            'cheaply, out for three after gloving a wayward delivery down leg '
            'to be snagged by wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne and Jansen’s third '
            'wicket of the day brought up his five-for, as Salman Ali Agha '
            'drove at only the third ball he faced and edged behind. Aamer '
            'Jamal was dismissed some 10 minutes before tea for 18 as he could '
            'not resist attempting to pull a short delivery from Paterson and '
            'was caught by Ryan Rickelton. Naseem Shah followed without '
            'scoring, after nicking Rabada to the slips. South Africa is '
            'chasing a win to secure a place in next year’s   although if they '
            'do not win, they have another opportunity in the second test '
            'against Pakistan, which starts at Newlands in Cape Town on '

            'escaping Lazio with a 1-1 draw which kept Inter Milan at bay but '
            'ended their club-record league winning streak at 11 matches. '
            'Marco Brescianini tapped home into an open goal with two minutes '
            'remaining to snatch a point from the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, '
            'where a passionate crowd thought a big win was coming their way. '
            'Instead Atalanta will end a historic year a point ahead of Inter, '
            'who have a game in hand, after the champions briefly drew level '
            'on points with a 3-0 win earlier at Cagliari. Europa League '
            'holders Atalanta will lead the league even if Napoli beat Venezia '
            'and draw level on 41 points with Gian Piero Gasperini’s side who '
            'have a significantly better goal difference than the 2023 '
            'champions. Should two teams finish level at the top of Serie A '
            'come the end of the season they will face off in a single match '
            'to decide the destination of the Scudetto, which Atalanta have '
            'never won. “We struggled for long periods in the first half, but '
            'we were much better in the second,” said Atalanta coach '
            'Gasperini. “This year has been the best year in Atalanta’s '
            'history, let’s hope we can make 2025 the same.” Atalanta showed '
            'great character to battle back from Fisayo Dele-Bashiru’s '
            '27th-minute goal which came in an intense opening period from '
            'Lazio. The away side were initially blitzed by Lazio, with Marco '
            'Carnesecchi making two sensational stops before Matteo Guendouzi '
            'curled a great strike off the post in the 11th minute. But as the '
            'match wore on, Atalanta, who were without injured star striker '
            'Mateo Retegui, grew into the game and deservedly drew level in '
            'front of a boisterous and hostile crowd in the Italian capital. '
            'Brescianini netted his third goal of the season thanks largely to '
            'Ademola Lookman, who made up for earlier missing from yards out '
            'by beating Lazio’s offside trap, meeting Nicolo Zaniolo’s hooked '
            'pass and rolling across to his team-mate to salvage a precious '
            'point. Next up, Atalanta travel to play the Italian Super Cup in '
            'Saudi Arabia, where they will face Inter on Thursday. Earlier, '
            'Lautaro Martinez ended an eight-match scoring drought at '
            'Cagliari, netting the second in an engaging contest in Sardinia '
            'which Inter won with second-half goals from the Argentina '
            'striker, Alessandro Bastoni and Hakan Calhanoglu. Inter have won '
            'their last five in Italy’s top flight, scoring 19 and conceding '
            'just once, a burst in form which has re-established Inter as '
            'favourites to retain the Scudetto. The only thing missing for '
            'Inter were goals from captain Martinez, who hadn’t scored since '
            'Nov 3 before he prodded home Nicolo Barella’s cross in the 71st '
            'minute on Saturday. “The most important thing is that Inter win. '
            'If I get a goal too, then that’s a bonus,” said Martinez. “We '
            'work hard every day to win trophies and anyone who sets foot on '
            'the pitch will give their all for the team. We’ve just got to '
            'keep going and make 2025 like this year.” Inter could have won by '
            'an even more convincing margin had captain Martinez not wasted '
            'great chances in each half and Cagliari goalkeeper Simone Scuffet '
            'not pulled off superb saves to deny Marcus Thuram and Barella. '
            'But Martinez did net his seventh goal this season in all '
            'competitions and seven minutes later Calhanoglu made absolutely '
            'sure of the points from the penalty spot. Cagliari are just '
            'inside the relegation zone after a fourth consecutive defeat for '

            'mostly dominated. However, India’s hopes were diminished by a '
            'stubborn, unbeaten final-wicket stand of 55 from 17.5 overs. '
            'Nathan Lyon was at the crease on 41 while number 11 Scott Boland '
            'had seen off 65 balls to be 10 not out at the close. Up by 105 '
            'runs on the first inn\xadings, Australia were rocked by losing '
            'four wickets for 11 midway thro\xadugh the second session to '
            'slump to 91-6. Marnus Labuschagne and Pat Cummins responded with '
            'a vital partnership of 57, taking the steam out of Bumrah’s '
            'assault. A charmed Labuschagne scored 70, to back up his '
            'first-innings 72, while Cummins produced a captain’s knock of 41 '
            '— giving him a career-high combined 90 runs for the Test. Both '
            'teams are seeking to go 2-1 up in the series heading into the '
            'fifth and final Test in Sydney. Australia remain in the stronger '
            'position on a pitch showing signs of variable bounce. “Their '
            'middle to lower order batting has been exceptional for the last '
            'four or five series we’ve played against them, so never '
            'comfortable with any amount of runs,” said Labuschagne after play '
            'ended. “At one stage we probably would have taken a 270 lead, and '
            'now the lower order has just put us in an amazing position with '
            '333. The conditions were exploited brilliantly by Bumrah, who '
            'continued his dominance across a series in which he has claimed '
            '29 wickets. The 31-year-old powered past 200 Test victims and he '
            'boasts the lowest average at 19.45 of all 85 bowlers to have '
            'reached that milestone. Labuschagne was beaten on numerous '
            'occasions by Bumrah’s jagging deliveries but kept his nerve in a '
            '139-ball knock. The Australian number three was fortunate, on 46, '
            'to survive a straightforward dropped chance in the slips by '
            'Yashasvi Jaiswal. Jaiswal also couldn’t grasp a sharp chance '

            'before Mitchell Starc was run out for five. Spinner Ravindra '
            'Jadeja had Cummins caught behind, heralding the 10th-wicket stand '
            'which could yet prove pivotal to the outcome. Siraj, who took '
            '3-66, sparked the earlier collapse, dismissing first innings '
            'centurion Steve Smith for 13. Bumrah was at his best when '
            'removing Travis He\xadad, Mitchell Marsh and Alex Carey cheaply '
            'in rapid-fire fashion. All-rounder Marsh was caught behind '
            'without scoring, continuing a series in which he has made little '
            'meaningful contribution. “It just happened so quickly,” said '
            'Labuschagne of Australia’s middle-order collapse. “As a new '
            'batter coming in, it’s very difficult to start in any Test match, '
            'but let alone when Bumrah’s got his tail up with the ball nipping '
            'around.” Australia lost both openers before going to lunch at '
            '53-2. Teenage opener Sam Konstas was unable to match the fearless '

            'Set an unlikely 340 to win, India looked well placed to salvage a '
            'draw when opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant batted through '
            'the second session in unflustered fashion to take their side to '
            '112-3 at tea.      But Pant perished trying to slog part-time '
            'spinner Travis Head for six to spark a collapse as India’s last '
            'seven wickets fell for 34 runs from 20.3 overs. Top-scorer '
            'Jaiswal was out for 84 to Australia captain and man-of-the match '
            'Pat Cummins, who took 3-28, and Nathan Lyon ended the contest '
            'when he trapped Mohammed Siraj lbw to spark wild scenes of '
            'jubilation among the home team. Pace bowler Mitchell Starc said '
            'the home side never lost faith they could force victory in the '
            'last session. “There were a few patches through the day with the '
            'wicket not doing a whole lot, but we managed to find a way,” '
            'Starc said. “I think that’s just a feature of the group at the '
            'moment, is that calmness, to have that belief that we can get the '
            'job done.” The departure of Pant for 30, caught on the boundary '
            'from a wild shot, ended an 88-run partnership and rejuvenated the '
            'Australia bowlers. Ravindra Jadeja and first-innings centurion '
            'Nitish Kumar Reddy came and went quickly before Cummins ended '
            'Jaiswal’s gritty 208-ball knock in controversial fashion. The '
            '23-year-old was given not out to a caught-behind appeal from an '
            'attempted hook. But the decision was overturned by the TV umpire '
            'on visual evidence that the ball had changed direction, even '
            'though no noise was picked up by technology. Akash Deep was '
            'caught at short leg off Scott Boland, who took 3-39, before '
            'Jasprit Bumrah scored his second duck of the match. A tenacious '
            'Washington Sundar was left not out five after facing 45 balls.\n'
            'Cummins completed an inspirational Test, taking six wickets in '
            'total and scoring 90 runs, the best batting match tally of his '
            'career. He terrorised India’s top order, removing opposing '
            'captain Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul before Starc dismissed Kohli '
            'from the last ball before lunch. Rohit, who has not scored more '
            'than 10 in the three Tests he has played in the series, said the '
            'early demise of the three veteran Indian batsmen removed any '
            'prospect of chasing their target. “We wanted to set the platform '
            'where the last two sessions, if we had wickets in hand, we can go '
            'for those runs. But they bowled perfectly as well,” Rohit said. '
            '“Then we wanted to fight till the end but unfortunately couldn’t '
            'do it. It is pretty disappointing. “If you look at the overall '
            'Test match, we had our opportunities, we had our chances.” Rohit '
            'said Australia’s final-wicket stand of 61 between Lyon and Boland '
            'in the second innings was a major dent in their push for victory. '
            'It came after exceptional Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who '
            'took 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match, '
            'had reduced the hosts to 91-6 midway through day four — a lead of '
            'less than 200. The final Australia second-innings wicket was '
            'finally taken early on Monday when Lyon was bowled for 41 by '
            'Bumrah, leaving Boland 15 not out. The match set the record '
            'attendance for any game of cricket in Australia, with 373,591 '
            'going through the gates over five days. Head said the players had '

            'one of the best Test matches that I’ve been involved in. “It’s '

            'are inimical forces both within and outside the country who are '
            'hard at work to reinstate the fallen tyrant by indulging in '
            'choreographed movements in some sectors. Various cadres of the '
            'civil service are agitating for their own “cause.” It seems that '
            'suddenly August 5 has generated the rise of a plethora of demands '
            'from various sectors, which had not been seen in the last 15 '
            'years. It also seems that there still are a significant number of '
            'sympathisers within the administration who are lying in wait for '
            'the opportune moment to create chaos and numb the administration. '
            'One suspects the deep state is at work, backseat-driving the '
            'government. Otherwise, how does one explain such a large number '
            'of Awami Leaguers finding their way out of the country? And we '
            'saw another physical manifestation of this in the fire incident '
            'at the secretariat. Everything points to a well-planned sabotage '
            'work. And this is not the last of such acts of sabotage. The '
            'warnings are clear that hostile forces are at work. The question '
            'is, how do we safeguard our revolution, the first being frittered '
            'away by a despot who had no love lost for the people of '
            'Bangladesh and felt little obligation for the country? The only '
            'way to preserve our newly acquired freedom is to put power where '
            'it belongs—to the people. And that brings us to the crux of the '
            'issue, that of reforms and election. So far, our base has been '
            'weakened. The civil administration and the judiciary, not to '
            'speak of the security sector, have been affected by the blatant '
            'regime of politicisation by Hasina. Can we proceed with business '
            'as usual with a rickety base to build on? The character of the '
            'state institutions would have to be restored before the next move '
            'in this respect. And that can be possible if we have people with '
            'impeccable antecedents and strong moral fibre to run these '
            'institutions. But by the same token, laws must be enacted to '
            'ensure that state institutions cannot be influenced by the '
            'government of the day. Can we also proceed without holding to '
            'account people responsible for  ? And human rights are violated '
            'in more ways than one. Can those who have siphoned off billions '
            'of dollars of the country’s wealth be allowed to go free? And '
            'those people include Hasina, her family members, and her cronies '
            'in the business world. Who will answer for the extrajudicial '
            'killings and the killing of the students in the recent '
            'uprising?      Can those who destroyed democracy, deprived the '
            'people of their right to choose their representatives, and made a '
            'mockery of parliament and the system be allowed to participate in '
            'future democratic exercises without paying for their misdeeds? We '
            'would like to end with a brief comment on the said report of the  '
            '. Bangladesh would need to repair  , it says. Let me stress that '
            'it is not for Bangladesh to repair ties with India; rather the '
            'opposite is true. Bangladesh has done nothing to impair the '
            'bilateral relationship. India has, on the other hand, not only '
            'given shelter to a person who stands accused of gross violation '
            'of human rights, corruption and other misdeeds in the country’s '
            'court of law; she is using the soil of India to conspire against '
            'Bangladesh. Since the fall and fleeing away of the autocrat, '
            'Indian political leaders have made threatening comments about '
            'Bangladesh. Our folly has been that we did not register our '
            'protests except for one instance. It is a pity that India has '
            'failed to see the reality and to honour the wish of the people of '
            'Bangladesh. The most important thing that is the call of the hour '
            'is national unity—this is the first safeguard for our Second '

            'of the 67 people on board. Azerbaijani officials have suggested '

            'day after he   to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A Kremlin '
            'statement on the phone call gave no indication that Putin had '
            'claimed responsibility for the crash. “The facts are that the '
            'Azerbaijani civilian plane was damaged from the outside over '
            'Russian territory, near the city of Grozny, and almost lost '
            'control,” Aliyev told state television. “We also know that '
            'electronic warfare systems put our plane out of control … At the '
            'same time, as a result of fire from the ground, the tail of the '
            'plane was also severely damaged,” he said. Aliyev said that while '
            '“of course, our plane was hit by accident”, Baku was angry that '
            'Moscow had apparently tried to hide the cause of the crash and '
            'demanded its ally admit what happened. He said it was '
            '“regrettable and surprising” that Moscow “put forward theories” '
            'that, he said, “clearly showed the Russian side wanted to cover '
            'up the issue”. “For the first three days, we heard nothing from '
            'Russia except some absurd theories,” he said, adding that these '
            'included the plane hitting a flock of birds.\n'
            'He called the theory “completely removed” from reality, pointing '
            'out that the plane’s “fuselage is riddled with holes”. Russia has '
            'said Grozny was being attacked by Ukrainian drones the day the '
            'AZAL flight tried to land. Aliyev urged Moscow to issue a public '
            'apology to his country, saying Baku had made official “demands” '
            'to Russia two days ago. “First, the Russian side must apologise '

            'responsibility, and compensation must be paid to the Azerbaijani '
            'state, as well as to the injured passengers and crew members. '
            '“These are our conditions,” Aliyev said, in unusually strong '
            'language towards Moscow. The Kremlin said on Saturday that during '
            'their phone conversation, Putin had apologised to Azerbaijan over '
            'the “tragic incident”. Putin said Russian air defence was '

            'fault. Later on Saturday, the Russian leader called for a '

            'Sunday. “Flight  , a Boeing 737-800, veered off the right side of '

            '(OSL),” according to a   issued by Royal Dutch Airlines and '
            'posted on X. The pilots chose to divert the aircraft to '
            'Sandefjord Torp Airport, 110 kilometres from Oslo, for an '
            'emergency landing, the news portal   said. Although the plane '
            'landed safely, it skidded off the runway shortly after and came '
            'to a halt in a grassy area adjacent to the runway, the media '
            'outlet said, citing a hydraulic system failure as the reason for '
            'the incident. It said 176 passengers and six crew members on '
            'board were not harmed, while an investigation has been launched '
            'into the incident. Meanwhile, an Air Canada flight was forced to '
            'make an emergency landing at Halifax Stanfield International '
            'Airport after experiencing a malfunction with its landing gear on '
            'Saturday night. Air Canada Flight 2259, departing from St. John’s '
            'International Airport, experienced landing troubles at 0130GMT '
            'that caused skidding and an engine fire, prompting a swift '
            'response from emergency crews to ensure the safety of all '
            'onboard, several media outlets reported. Passenger Nikki '
            'Valentine told   that one of the plane’s tyres did not deploy '
            'properly upon landing. “The plane started to sit at about a '
            '20-degree angle to the left, and, as that happened, we heard a '
            'pretty loud — what almost sounded like a crash sound — as the '
            'wing of the plane started to skid along the pavement, along with '
            'what I presume was the engine,” she said. Upon landing, the '
            'people on board were evacuated and then taken to a hangar to be '
            'checked out by paramedics. No casualties have been reported. As a '
            'precaution, flights at the Halifax airport were temporarily '
            'suspended following the incident, while as of the early hours of '
            'Sunday, one runway has reopened. Hours after the crash, family '
            'members gathered in the airport’s arrival area, some crying and '
            'hugging as Red Cross volunteers handed out blankets. Families '
            'screamed and wept loudly as a medic announced the names of 22 '
            'victims identified by their fingerprints. Papers were circulated '
            'for families to write down their contact details. One relative '
            'stood at a microphone to ask for more information from '
            'authorities. “My older brother died and I don’t know what’s going '
            'on,” he said. “I don’t know.” Another asked journalists not to '
            'film. “We are not monkeys in a zoo,” he said. “We are the '
            'bereaved families.” Mortuary vehicles lined up outside to take '
            'bodies away, and authorities said a temporary morgue had been '
            'established. The crash site smelled of aviation fuel and blood, '
            'according to   witnesses, and workers in protective suits and '
            'masks combed the area while soldiers searched through '
            'bushes.      Authorities had worked to rescue people in the tail '
            'section, an airport official told   shortly after the crash. The '
            'crash is the worst by any South Korean airline since a 1997 '
            'Korean Air crash in Guam that killed more than 200 people, '
            'according to transportation ministry data. The worst on South '
            'Korean soil was an Air China crash that killed 129. Investigators '
            'are looking into bird strikes and weather conditions as possible '
            'factors, Lee said.   cited airport authorities as saying a bird '
            'strike may have caused the landing gear to malfunction. The '
            'control tower issued a bird strike warning and shortly afterward '
            'the pilots declared mayday, a transport ministry official said, '
            'without specifying whether the flight said it struck any birds. '
            'About one minute after the mayday call the aircraft made its '
            'ill-fated attempt to land, the official said. A passenger texted '
            'a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing, the News1 agency '
            'reported. The person’s final message was, “Should I say my last '
            'words?” The passengers included two Thai nationals and the rest '
            'are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation '
            'ministry. Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae apologised for the accident, '
            'bowing deeply during a televised briefing. He said the cause of '
            'the crash was still unknown, that the aircraft had no record of '
            'accidents and there were no early signs of malfunction. The '
            'airline will cooperate with investigators and make supporting the '
            'bereaved its top priority, Kim said.      No abnormal conditions '
            'were reported when the aircraft left Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi '
            'Airport, said Kerati Kijmanawat, president of Airports of '
            'Thailand. It is the first fatal flight for Jeju Air, a low-cost '
            'airline founded in 2005 that ranks behind only Korean Air Lines '
            'and Asiana Airlines in terms of the number of passengers in South '
            'Korea. The accident happened only three weeks after it started '
            'regular flights from Muan to Bangkok and other Asian cities on '
            'December 8. Muan International is one of South Korea’s smallest '
            'airports but it has seen the number of international passengers '
            'jump nearly 20 times to 310,702 from January to November this '
            'year, from the same period in 2022, according to government data. '
            'Boeing said in an emailed statement, “We are in contact with Jeju '
            'Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We '
            'extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved '
            'ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew.” The '
            'US Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to '
            'a request for comment. All domestic and international flights at '
            'Muan airport had been cancelled,   reported. South Korean acting '
            'President Choi Sang-mok,   of the country on Friday in an ongoing '

            'the government was putting all its resources into dealing with '
            'the crash. Two Thai women were on the plane, aged 22 and 45, Thai '
            'government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub said, adding that details '
            'were still being verified. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn '

            'with the local side,” he said in an interview with Russian news '

            'have at times run aground, mostly because of strong winds and '
            'sandstorms. Suez Canal Authority chief Osama Rabie said the '
            'development in the canal’s southern region will “enhance '
            'navigational safety and reduce the effects of water and air '
            'currents on passing ships”. It would open only after new '
            'navigational maps are issued, he said. In 2021, giant container '

            'lost approximately $7 billion in Suez Canal revenue in 2024, '
            'marking more than a 60pc drop from 2023. According to the Suez '
            'Canal Authority, the latest expansion extends the total length of '
            'the canal’s two-way section to 82km from a previous 72km. The '
            'canal is 193km long in total. “This expansion will boost the '
            'canal’s capacity by an additional six to eight ships on a daily '
            'basis and enhance its ability to handle potential emergencies,” '
            'the Suez Canal Authority stated. In 2015, Egypt undertook an '
            '$8-billion expansion to the waterway, followed by several smaller '
            'development projects. The Suez Canal has long been a vital source '

            'Wednesday, the centre-left Labour government has announced, in a '
            'move set to raise over £1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) for public '
            'education. After years of worsening educational inequalities, '
            'from Jan 1, private schools will have to pay 20 per cent   on '
            'tuition fees, which will be used to fund thousands of new '
            'teachers and improve standards in state schools. “It’s time '
            'things are done differently”, finance minister Rachel Reeves said '
            'in a statement on Sunday. The funding will  “go towards our state '
            'schools where 94pc of this country’s children are educated”, she '
            'said. The policy was promised by Labour in its election campaign '
            'and officially laid out in its inaugural budget in October. It '
            'hopes the move will bring in 1.5 billion for the 2025/2026 school '
            'year and rise to 1.7 billion a year by 2029/2030, which will be '
            'used to fund 6,500 new teachers in the public sector. Despite '
            'warnings from private schools, the govt is ploughing ahead and '
            'will charge 20pc VAT on independent school fees Tuition fees in '
            'private schools already average 18,000 a year, according to the '
            'Independent Schools Council, which represents private schools. '
            'That figure is set to rise, with the government estimating that '
            'tuition fees will increase by around 10pc, with schools taking on '
            'part of the additional cost. “High and rising standards cannot '
            'just be for families who can afford them,” said education '
            'secretary Bridget Phillipson.      Opponents of the reform say '
            'state school enrolment will explode if the private sector is '
            'lost, increasing the cost to the government. But studies '
            'contradict this. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that '
            'the number of children in state schools will actually fall by '
            '2030 due to a projected population decline. Several research '
            'centres also point out that the disparity between private and '
            'state schools widened sharply under the 14-year Conservative '
            'rule. Despite warnings from private schools over the impact of '
            'the policy, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is ploughing ahead '
            'and will charge 20pc VAT on independent school fees from the '
            'start of 2025. According to  , private school leaders have warned '
            'the combination of tax hikes in the budget and the removal of '
            'their charitable status, which saw fees exempted from VAT, could '
            'lead the sector to “fall apart”. They have also argued that the '
            'hike in school fees as a result of the policies will force more '
            'children into the state sector, overwhelming already stretched '
            'schools and wiping out any gains to the public finances. And, '
            'ahead of the policy coming into force, Liberal Democrat education '
            'spokesperson Munira Wilson said: “Students and teachers across '
            'our education system are crying out for support, but we’ve been '
            'clear the government’s decision to tax education is the wrong '
            'approach. “The government should now lay out what effect this '
            'misguided policy will have on the families of the 100,000 '
            'children with special educational needs currently at independent '
            'schools who do not have education, health and care plans.” The '

            'of mouth-watering flavours, and the advantage of avoiding that '
            'nasty smoke smell on fingers. But since e-cigarettes still '
            'contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, critics fear they '
            'could be a potential stepping stone to more traditional tobacco '
            'products. “The problem is that young people start using vapes '
            'without always knowing their nicotine content, and nicotine is '
            'addictive,” said Nora Melard, spokeswoman for the Alliance for a '
            'Tobacco-Free Society in Belgium. “We have young people saying '
            'they wake up at night to take a puff,” she told  . “It’s very '
            'worrying.” Belgium boasts it has reacted quickly to the dangers '
            'posed by disposable e-cigarettes, which hit the market more than '
            'five years ago. In 2021, the federal government submitted a '
            'proposal to the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, to '
            'ban single-use vapes. The commission, which must give its '
            'approval for any sales ban, accorded a green light to Belgium in '
            'March 2024, paving the way for a national law to enter into '
            'force. France has obtained EU acceptance for a similar ban. Once '
            'enacted, the French law will ban the production, sale and free '
            'offer of vapes, with a fine of 100,000 euros ($104,000) for any '
            'violations. Health authorities in France and Belgium say that '
            'chronic nicotine consumption is especially harmful to the '
            'adolescent brain and could encourage the use of other drugs. An '
            'EU study in 2023 found the majority of e-cigarette users opted '
            'for a rechargeable vape but the single-use versions were popular '
            'with young people aged 15 to 24. Easy to use and advertised '
            'everywhere on social media, disposable vapes are also attractive '
            'for their low cost. At five or six euros, one single-use vape is '
            'half the price of a 20-pack of cigarettes. Some allow for up to '
            '9,000 puffs, the equivalent of more than 300 cigarettes, '
            'according to experts.      Many Brussels tobacco shops are '
            'running out of single-use e-cigarettes, as renewal is impossible. '
            '“I don’t understand why vapes are banned and not tobacco, which '
            'is also dangerous,” one young user, Ilias Ratbi, told  . Others '
            'welcome the ban. “I think it’s good to stop selling it,” said '
            'Yona Bujniak in central Brussels. “There are a lot of young '
            'people who start without necessarily thinking about the '
            'consequences.” Opponents also point to the “ecological disaster” '
            'caused by disposable vapes. When seeking the EU’s approval for '
            'its ban, Belgium argued that the plastic single-use vape with its '
            'lithium battery usually gets thrown away within five days of '
            'purchase. By contrast, the rechargeable versions can last for '
            'around six or seven months.',

            'Directorate put the death toll “so far” at 68 men and three '
            'women. “The accident was especially horrific as the river had a '
            'lot of big stones so most passengers, including the driver, were '
            'killed due to the impact,” Wossenyeleh Simon, an official with '
            'the regional communications department, told  . “Among the '
            'deceased are four people from the same family,” he said.\n'
            'He said that the driver had lost control of the “freight truck” — '

            'wedding and day labourers — when trying to turn a tight bend '

            'beyond its capacity as there were a scarce number of passenger '
            'vehicles operating during that day,” he added. Blurred images '

            'from a nearby hospital were quickly on the scene on Sunday, '
            '“helping retrieve the bodies of the deceased and also conducting '
            'search and rescue operations for survivors”. Of the five '
            'individuals who survived, two sustained serious injuries and were '
            'currently receiving care at Hawassa Referral Hospital. He added '
            'that three had already been discharged, although they were '
            'suffering from “mental stress and psychological (shock)”. Road '
            'accidents are common in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous '
            'nation, where roads are often poorly maintained. Earlier this '
            'year a bus swerved into a river in southern Ethiopia in Wolaita '

            'largest ratio of vehicle deaths, often a result of poor '
            'infrastructure, scant rescuers and old cars. Home to only around '
            '4 per cent of the world’s automobiles, Africa accounted for 19pc '

            'healthcare facilities “may amount to a form of collective '
            'punishment, which would also constitute a war crime”. UN High '

            'law, they are not getting away with it because several '
            'organisations are reporting on this,” he said, “Where they are '

            'just days to announce Russia as a state that has committed crimes '
            'for hitting one clinic in the past,” he added. Barakat said what '
            'made the difference was “political will,” in particular that of '
            'the United States. Speaking of Israel’s possible plans for the '
            'future of Gaza, Barakat said the military was likely to keep the '
            'northern portion of the Strip under occupation to “try and push '
            'Hamas as far away as possible from Tel Aviv”. “This would be in '
            'their eyes the best option before they try to implement the '
            'better plan, which is pushing Palestinians into the Naqab [Negev] '
            'desert into Egypt,” he said. US-based Ford Motor Company has said '

            'offensive on the Gaza Strip. The posts had already made their '
            'rounds across social media by X users before being deleted.      '
            'The Palestinian group has said the recent deaths of five '
            'prisoners in Israeli jails are “a clear evidence of the extent of '
            'the occupation’s brutality and its detachment from all human '
            'values”,   reports. In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of “the '

            'negligence, the acts of torture, abuse and deprivation” towards '

            'American bias against our people”. It also called on the '
            'Palestinian people to organise “mass activities to support the '
            'prisoners” and urged “human rights organisations to take '
            'effective positions” against Israel. Once muscular and strong, '
            'Palestinian bodybuilder Moazaz Obaiyats nine-month spell in '
            'Israeli custody left him unable to walk unaided upon his release '
            'in July. Then, in an October pre-dawn raid on his home, soldiers '
            'detained him again. Before being re-arrested, the 37-year-old '
            'father of five was diagnosed with severe PTSD by Bethlehem '
            'Psychiatric Hospital, related to his time at Israel’s remote '
            'Ktz’iot prison, according to medical notes seen by   from the '
            'hospital, a public clinic in the occupied West Bank. The notes '
            'said Obaiyat was subjected to “physical and psychological '
            'violence and torture” in prison and described symptoms including '
            'severe anxiety, withdrawal from his family and avoidance of '
            'discussion of traumatic events and current affairs. Alleged '
            'abuses and psychological harm to Palestinian detainees in Israeli '
            'prisons and camps are in renewed focus amid stepped-up efforts in '
            'December by international mediators to secure a ceasefire that '
            'could see the release of thousands of inmates detained during the '
            'Gaza conflict and before, in return for Israeli hostages held by  '
            'Hamas. The Gaza Civil Defence has said it received hundreds of '
            'distress calls from displaced Palestinians whose tents and '
            'shelters were flooded by rainwater,    . “Our crews can only '
            'evacuate citizens from their damaged shelters to other places '
            'that are mostly unsuitable to shelter, and they remain in the '
            'open — under the rain and bitter cold,” it said on Telegram. “We '
            'appeal to people of conscience to rush to save these families and '
            'help them move to suitable shelters that protect them from '
            'rainwater,” it added. The statement added that displaced people '
            'in the refugee camps in central Gaza City, al-Mawasi, Khan '
            'Younis, Rafah and western Deir el-Balah, in particular, need '

            'of Parliament Jeremy Corbyn has described late US President Jimmy '
            'Carter as “one of the only US Presidents to speak honestly about '
            'Palestine”.  a video of Carter on social media, Corbyn quotes the '
            'late president, who died at the age of 100, using the word '
            '“apartheid” to describe the situation for Palestinians under '
            'Israeli occupation. “The word apartheid… is exactly accurate,” '
            'Carter was quoted as saying in the interview. “The Palestinians '
            'can’t even ride on the same roads that the Israelis have created '
            'or built in Palestinian territory,” Carter said.      Live '
            'bullets were fired when Israeli forces and local Palestinians '
            'clashed during a raid by Israel’s military on Anabta town, '

            'during the violence yesterday night, which began when Israeli '
            'military vehicles stormed into the centre of the town and '
            'conducted patrols,   said. Israeli soldiers also raided al-Khader '
            'town, located south of Bethlehem, where they took up positions in '
            'two neighbourhoods and were reported to have used sound bombs. '
            'There were no reports of casualties, according to  . Six young '

            'Israel is continuing to dismantle the “very means of people’s '
            'survival” across Gaza, and “systematically” hindering '
            'humanitarian access to the Palestinian enclave,   reports. The '
            'agency   Israel allowed UN agencies on Sunday to deliver food, '
            'water and basic medical supplies to critical patients who had '
            'been forced to flee Kamal Adwan Hospital and take shelter at the '
            'non-functional Indonesian Hospital. But this mission was '
            '“exceptional” because Israel has denied all other attempts to '
            'access the area over the past three days. “OCHA emphasises that '
            'it should not require breaking a siege to help survivors in '
            'critical need. Aid workers must be granted safe and unhindered '
            'access to assist people wherever they are,” it said. “OCHA '
            'stresses that humanitarian access remains systematically hindered '
            'across the Gaza Strip. In the past three days, over 60 per cent '
            'of the 42 UN-coordinated movements were denied, interfered with '
            'or impeded on the ground,” it added. Mohammed al-Houthi, the head '
            'of the Houthi Supreme Council in Yemen, has promised to continue '
            'attacks on Israel in support of Gaza and called on the UN '
            'Security Council to take action against what he called US and '
            'Israeli “terrorism”,   reports. The   on X came as the Security '
            'Council met in New York to discuss the Israel-Houthi conflict. '
            '“We affirm that respect for international law begins with the '
            'implementation of Security Council resolutions regarding '
            'Palestine,” al-Houthi wrote. “We confirm that any talk that does '
            'not include stopping the aggression on Gaza and Yemen is nonsense '
            'and chatter,” he was quoted as saying. The Euro-Med Human Rights '
            'Monitor has urged the UN to take swift action after Palestinian '
            'authorities claimed that five more detainees from Gaza have been '
            'killed in Israeli prisons,   reports. “The UN must send an '
            'international investigative mission to look into the grave crimes '
            'and violations that Palestinian prisoners and detainees endure in '
            'Israeli prisons and detention facilities,” it said in a '
            'statement. The rights group said the latest deaths bring the '
            'total number of Palestinian prisoners and detainees killed in '
            'Israeli prisons since Oct 7, 2023, to at least 54. The number '
            'includes 34 Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. “According to '
            'former detainees’ testimonies, the true number of victims could '
            'be more than twice as high,” Euro-Med Monitor said. The group '
            'also slammed what it called inaction by the UN’s rapporteur on '
            'torture, Alice Gill Edwards, and called on the organisation’s '
            'Human Rights Council to fire the expert and appoint a new person. '
            'In Gaza’s Deir al-Balah city, dozens of tents — many already '
            'tattered from months of use — have been blown away or flooded by '
            'the strong winds and rain, leaving families struggling to repair '
            'the damage, patching torn sheets of plastic and piling up sand to '
            'hold back the water,   reports. “The water seeped inside and on '
            'the mattresses and my children’s clothes. I changed the '
            'children’s clothes this morning to their underwear,” said Sabreen '
            'Abu Shanab, a mother of three, whose tent was flooded. “They were '
            'sleeping and soaked wet to their underwear. I swear. The pants '
            'and underwear [were all soaked]. Everything is soaked, the '
            'blankets, the pillows, everything,” added the woman. Abu Shanab '
            'suffers from asthma and despite medication, she has not been '
            'feeling better for a month because of the cold weather and the '
            'lack of heavy blankets and clothes. In the second winter of '
            'Israel’s operation in Gaza, the weather has added an extra '
            'element of suffering to hundreds of thousands of people already '
            'displaced, often multiple times, while efforts to agree a '
            'ceasefire go nowhere.      Yahya Al-Batran woke up in the early '
            'hours of Sunday morning to find his wife, Noura trying to wake '
            'their newborn twin sons Jumaa and Ali as they lay together in the '
            'makeshift tent the family occupied in an encampment in the '
            'central Gaza Strip,   reports. “She said she had been trying to '
            'wake Jumaa up, but he was not waking up, and I asked about Ali '
            'and she said, he was not walking up either,” he told   on Sunday. '
            '“I held up Jumaa, he was white and freezing like snow, like ice,\n'
            'frozen.” Jumaa, a month old, died of hypothermia, one of six '
            'Palestinians who have died of exposure and cold over recent days '
            'in Gaza, according to doctors. Ali was in critical condition '
            'yesterday in intensive care. “Since I am an adult I may take this '
            'and endure it, but what did the young one do to deserve this?” '
            'Jumaa’s mother, Noura al-Batran said, as she held embraced her '
            'son’s colourful blanket to her chest. “He could not endure it, he '
            'could not endure the cold or the hunger and this hopelessness.” '
            'Yahya al-Batran’s family, from the northern town of Beit Lahiya, '
            'fled their home early in the offensive for al-Maghazi, an '
            'open-air patch of dunes and scrubland in central Gaza which '
            'Israeli authorities decreed as a humanitarian zone. Later on, as '
            'al-Maghazi became increasingly unsafe, they moved to another '
            'encampment in nearby Deir al-Balah city.      Israel’s ambassador '
            'to the United Nations has issued what he called a final warning '
            'to Yemen’s Houthi militants to halt their missile attacks on '
            'Israel, saying they risked the same “miserable fate” as Hamas, '
            'Hezbollah and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad if they persisted,   '
            'reports. Danny Danon, addressing the UN Security Council, said '
            'that Israel would not tolerate further Houthi attacks. “To the '
            'Houthis, perhaps you have not been paying attention to what has '
            'happened to the Middle East over the past year,” he said. “Well, '
            'allow me to remind you what has happened to Hamas, to Hezbollah, '
            'to Assad, to all those who have attempted to destroy us. Let this '
            'be your final warning. This is not a threat. It is a promise. You '
            'will share the same miserable fate,” Danon said. Before the '
            'meeting, Danon told reporters: “Israel will defend its people. If '
            '2,000 kilometres is not enough to separate our children from the '
            'terror, let me assure you, it will not be enough to protect their '
            'terror from our strengths.” The ambassador, Danon, also warned '
            'Tehran that Israel has the ability to strike any target in the '
            'Middle East, including in Iran. He added that Israel would not '
            'tolerate attacks by Iranian proxies. But hours later the Israeli '
            'military announced that it had intercepted a missile fired from '
            'Yemen, prompting sirens to sound across the country, and a top '
            'Houthi leader said the group would not end its attacks on Israel. '
            'The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said that '
            'the health care system in northern Gaza had been “obliterated” by '
            'fighting between Israel and Hamas, with hospitals rendered '
            '“completely inoperable”,   reports. “Repeated hostilities in and '
            'around hospitals have obliterated the health care system in '
            'northern Gaza, putting civilians at an unacceptably grave risk of '
            'going without lifesaving care,” the ICRC said in a statement. It '
            'called for the respect and protection of medical facilities in '
            'line with international humanitarian law. “This protection is a '
            'legal obligation and a moral imperative to preserve human life,” '
            'it added, saying hospitals were a lifeline for those sick or '
            'wounded in conflict. “The Kamal Adwan and Indonesian hospitals '
            'are now completely inoperable.\n'
            'For months, these medical facilities have struggled to provide '
            'care for patients as ongoing hostilities have damaged hospitals '
            'and endangered or harmed staff, patients, and civilians.” Four '
            'more Palestinian detainees from Gaza have died in Israeli '
            'custody,   reports. A statement by the Commission of Detainees’ '
            'Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoner Society identified the four '
            'victims as Mohammad al-Akka, 44, Samir al-Kahlout, 52, Zuhair '
            'al-Sharif, 58, and Mohammad Lubbad, 57. “What is happening to the '
            'detainees is just another aspect of the [Israeli] war of '
            'extermination,” the statement said. New fatalities bring the '
            'number of Palestinian detainees who have died in Israeli custody '
            'since October 7, 2023 to 54, according to Palestinian figures. '
            'France has condemned the Israeli military operations targeting '
            'several hospitals in Gaza, including Kamal Adwan, which is now '
            'out of service,   reports. The French Foreign Ministry in a '
            'statement expressed its concern for the situation of the '
            'hospital’s director, as well as patients and healthcare workers. '
            '“France reminds Israel of its obligation to comply with '
            'international humanitarian law, which specifically provides for '
            'the protection of hospital infrastructure,” it said. “Faced with '
            'the absolute humanitarian emergency in Gaza, where the situation '
            'of civilians has been unacceptable for too long, France calls on '
            'the parties to negotiate without delay an immediate and lasting '
            'ceasefire, which alone will allow the massive entry of '
            'humanitarian aid through all access points to the Gaza Strip, the '
            'release of all hostages and the protection of all civilians.” '
            'Shorouq al-Rantisi, 30, a nurse in Kamal Adwan Hospital’s '
            'laboratory department, was among the women taken from the '
            'hospital by the Israeli military, she has recounted the raid to   '
            'Maram Humaid. “We could hear the men being beaten and tortured. '
            'It was unbearable,” she says. Then the searches started, she '
            'adds. “The soldiers were dragging the women by the head towards '
            'the search area,” al-Rantisi said. “[They] shouted at us, '
            'demanding we remove our headscarves. Those who refused were '
            'beaten badly.” Israel’s raid merely compounded “the global '
            'silence and abandonment” Palestinians in Gaza have been faced '
            'with throughout more than a year of relentless Israeli attacks '
            'that killed more than 45,000 people, al-Rantisi said. “Over 60 '
            'days of relentless shelling — quadcopters, artillery, and '
            'targeted strikes on generators.” Five times in the course of the '
            'past year, the world’s leading hunger monitor warned that Gaza '
            'could be teetering on the precipice of famine. Each time, the '
            'watchdog stopped short of concluding one was under way,   '
            'reports. Gregory Shay, a retired pediatric pulmonologist from '
            'California, spent October treating children in Gaza, and to him, '
            'it looked like famine was gripping the territory. Shay worked at '
            'Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. Most of '
            'the children he treated subsisted on bread and rice, recalled '
            'Shay, a volunteer with the US-based non-profit organization '
            'MedGlobal. Without vegetables, fruit or meat, he said, the '
            'children lacked the vitamins or minerals needed to stave off '
            'disease. Most days, Shay said he treated on average 40 new '
            'patients who were admitted to the hospital. Many had severe cases '
            'of pneumonia, and several others suffered from meningitis, an '
            'illness that can kill in hours. Newborns were often small for '
            'their age, he said. Some had birth defects or suffered from '
            'neonatal sepsis, a blood infection that’s a leading cause of '
            'infant mortality. “I’ve never seen the kind and number of '
            'infections that I saw in Gaza,” said Shay, who has made 35 '
            'medical aid trips during the past decade, “You just look at these '
            'kids and you know that it’s a famine.”',

{'author': 'Muqaddam Khan',
 'category': None,
 'content': 'SWABI: A two-month delay in announcing the annual procurement '
            'target appears to be a deliberate attempt to harm tobacco '
            'cultivators as national and multinational companies are further '
            'reducing their procurement targets for the upcoming year, '
            'industry sources told   on Friday. Continuing the downtrend, '
            'these companies have reduced their total tobacco requirements by '
            '2.5 million kg, bringing the total to 74.810 million kilograms '
            'for the calendar year 2025, the sources confirmed to  . The '
            'sources said the total demand for 2025 would be lower by 3.24 per '
            'cent over the current year’s 77.322m kg. The demand was 85.5m kg '
            'in 2023. According to the sources, the companies reduced their '
            'demand by 10.69m kg or 10.5pc during the last two years. Earlier, '
            'these purchasing companies had succeeded in luring tobacco '
            'cultivators to grow more. Delayed quota announcement put growers '
            'in a quandary Under the law, these companies must announce their '
            'required tobacco quota for the upcoming year through the Pakistan '
            'Tobacco Board (PTB), the sector regulator. The Martial Law Order '
            '(MLO) 487, which regulates the purchase of tobacco in Pakistan, '
            'requires the buyer companies to announce their quota every year '
            'for the upcoming year by Oct 31, giving an option to the farmers '
            'whether they want to cultivate tobacco or wheat crops. The '
            'farmers said that the wheat sowing period had already ended, and '
            'now, if the companies have reduced the quota, they have no other '
            'option except to grow tobacco. The sources lamented that the '
            'sector regulator has failed to protect cultivators from the '
            'manipulative practices of major tobacco-buying companies. They '
            'said that the companies and the PTB would now tell the growers '
            'that they should execute agreements with the buyers of their '
            'choice but with a string that surplus produce would not be '
            'lifted. The sources said the regulator’s inaction exposes the '
            'obvious nexus, leaving the cultivators at the mercy of big '
            'companies, which, in connivance with the PTB, have forced the '
            'farmers to suffer financial losses for no fault. “In fact, the '
            'companies are responsible for the entire mess,” lamented Liaqat '

 'content': 'ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday expressed concern over   '
            'rainfall, which could make it difficult to meet the Rabi crop '
            'output  . The Ministry of Finance, in its Monthly Economic Update '
            'and Outlook for December, acknowledged the importance of '
            'supporting farmers to achieve agricultural output targets, which '
            'are critical for reaching the overall economic goals for FY25 and '
            'sustaining economic recovery. The government highlighted the '
            'potential challenges posed by weather conditions, particularly '
            'below-normal rainfall, which may lead to water stress during the '
            'crucial emerging stage of Rabi crops such as wheat and barley, '
            'particularly in rain-fed agricultural zones. The government '
            'forecasts GDP growth of 3.6 per cent for FY25, while the State '
            'Bank of Pakistan has projected growth in the range of 2.5pc to '
            '3.5pc. The World Bank, however, anticipates a 2.8pc expansion in '
            'GDP for FY25. Despite challenges in some sectors, there is '
            'optimism that the government can achieve its GDP growth target, '
            'as industrial output shows signs of improvement, exports continue '
            'their growth momentum, and remittances have increased. Despite '
            'challenges in some sectors, govt may achieve GDP growth target On '
            'the industrial front, while certain sectors remain in negative  '
            'territory, the economy’s resilience is demonstrated by the '
            'strong  performance of high-weighted sectors, which continue to '
            'drive  Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in October. Both the '
            'automobile and  cement sectors exhibited robust performance in '
            'November, providing a  much-needed boost to allied industries. '
            'The finance ministry emphasised  that the ripple effect and '
            'interconnectedness of industrial sectors  could reinforce broader '
            'economic growth. Furthermore, the recent easing of monetary '
            'policy in December is expected to stimulate economic activity. '
            'The increasing demand for credit, particularly from the private '
            'sector, is a positive sign of growing confidence in the economy. '
            'This momentum is expected to accelerate, fostering higher '
            'production levels and enhanced economic output in the coming '
            'months. On the agriculture side, the government has set a wheat '
            'production target of 27.92 million tonnes for Rabi 2024-25, to be '
            'harvested from an area of 9.26m hectares. To achieve this, '
            'efforts are under way to ensure the timely availability of '
            'essential farm inputs, including agricultural credit, quality '
            'seeds, fertilisers, and mechanisation support. Agricultural '
            'credit disbursement for July-November FY2025 reached Rs925.7 '
            'billion, an 8.5pc increase compared to Rs853bn during the same '
            'period last year. This positive trend is expected to continue, '
            'aligning with the ambitious agriculture credit target of Rs2.572 '
            'trillion for FY25. The increase in agricultural machinery sales, '
            'as well as higher urea and DAP offtake, further signals sectoral '
            'growth. The rise in DAP offtake is attributed to the Punjab '
            'government’s initiative of providing interest-free loans to small '
            'farmers through the Kissan Card Programme for the purchase of '
            'agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilisers. Externally, '
            'stability is expected to continue, supported by remittances and '
            'export inflows, while imports remain manageable. Exchange rate '
            'stability and controlled inflation, forecast to stay within the '
            '4-5pc range for December 2024, are expected to complement this '
            'stability. The government also expects its improved fiscal '
            'performance during July-October, driven by higher revenues and '
            'prudent expenditure management, to create fiscal space for '
            'development spending and support sustainable economic growth. '
            'Global commodity prices, however, have shown mixed trends. Energy '
            'prices decreased by 1.2pc in November, driven by a 4.7pc decline '
            'in natural gas prices and a 3.1pc drop in coal prices. Non-energy '
            'prices saw little change. Fertiliser prices dropped by 3pc, while '
            'meal prices contracted by 3.1pc. The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) '
            'averaged 127.5 points in November 2024, a 0.5pc increase from '
            'October, reaching its highest value since April 2023. This rise '
            'was driven by higher prices for dairy products and vegetable '
            'oils, which outweighed declines in meat, cereals, and sugar '
            'prices. Compared to historical levels, the FFPI in November was '
            '5.7pc higher than the corresponding value a year ago, but still '
            '20.4pc below its peak of 160.2 points reached in March 2022.',

            'on Monday, marking the second-highest single-day point-wise gain '
            'in the PSX history. This rally was primarily driven by fresh '
            'inflows following the steep correction in the previous week. As '
            'the week progressed, the market sentiments remained mixed.  The '
            'government raised Rs913bn at the T-bill auction, falling short of '

            '($4.7m) followed by ‘all-other-sectors’ ($2m). On the local '
            'front, buying was reported by individuals ($14.9m) and '

            'companies, higher sustainable ROEs of banks and improving cash '
            'flows of E&Ps and OMCs, amid falling fixed income yields.  '

            'months, the PSX delivered a 177pc return in dollar terms (169pc '
            'in rupee terms), driven by macroeconomic stabilisation and '
            'improvements in external accounts,” Topline Securities Ltd CEO '
            'Mohammed Sohail said in its post on LinkedIn. Despite the rally, '
            'he noted that the market capitalisation was still $50bn, half its '
            '2017 peak of $100bn. This decline was due to the rupee '
            'devaluation, large dividend payouts, and fewer listings. As a '
            'percentage of GDP, the PSX was at 11pc, below the 10-year average '

            'investments, and bold reforms, significant progress has been made '
            'towards ensuring energy sustainability, reducing electricity '
            'costs, and driving economic growth. Claims reducing tariffs with '

            'terminated in the first phase, achieving national savings of '
            'Rs411 billion and annual savings of Rs70bn. “In the second phase, '
            'agreements with eight bagasse-based IPPs have been settled, '
            'resulting in annual savings of Rs8.826bn and national savings of '
            'Rs238.22bn, while negotiation with 16 other IPPs was underway, '
            'which will result in savings of Rs481bn. “The power sector has '
            'witnessed tariff reductions as the average price of electricity '

            '2024, marking a reduction of Rs4.66,” he stated. He added that '
            'the industrial tariff had also significantly dropped to Rs47.17 '
            'per unit from Rs58.50 in June 2024, reflecting a reduction of '
            'Rs11.33. The minister presented a detailed overview of reforms '
            'undertaken in the last nine months. “We have eliminated Rs150bn '
            'in cross-subsidies from the industrial sector, a step that has '
            'boosted industrial growth and job creation in Pakistan,” he '
            'highlighted. Mr Leghari emphasised that the government was '
            'diligently working on upgrading the transmission sector, '
            'including the bifurcation of the National Transmission and '
            'Despatch Company into three entities. These three entities will '
            'be the ‘National Grid Company of Pakistan’ being established for '
            'efficient and reliable transmission, the ’Energy '
            'Infra\xadstructure Development and Management Company for project '
            'management, and the ’Independent System and Market Operator for a '
            'competitive and transparent electricity market. He highlighted '
            'the solarisation of agricultural tube wells in Balochistan. “We '
            'are solarising 27,000 tube wells at Rs55bn, with a 70pc federal '
            'government contribution.” The minister boasted that this '
            'initiative would promote green energy and revolutionise the '
            'agricultural sector in Balochistan. He acknowledged the '
            'challenges faced by the power sector, including transmission '
            'constraints and poor recovery rates, which contribute to Rs250bn '
            'in losses caused by Discos’ inefficiencies. “Efforts to manage '
            'the Rs2.2tr circular debt burden were ongoing, focusing on '
            'reducing consumer electricity costs. We are also addressing the '
            'impact of dollar-denominated debt as the depreciation of the '
            'rupee has exacerbated it,” he said. The minister elaborated on '
            'the Bijli Sahulat Package, saying that this package introduces a '
            'special tariff of Rs26.07 per unit for households and industries. '
            'Under this package, domestic consumers will benefit from savings '
            'between Rs11.42 and Rs26.00 per unit, while commercial consumers '
            'can expect savings of Rs13.46 to Rs22.71 per unit. “The '
            'industrial users will enjoy savings ranging from Rs5.72 to '
            'Rs15.05 per unit, and this initiative underscores our commitment '
            'to reducing electricity costs and supporting economic growth,” Mr '
            'Leghrai added. However, he did not elaborate further on the '
            'package. He made a futuristic announcement about the government’s '
            'plan to introduce special tariffs for electric vehicles (EVs) '
            'under a forthcoming EV policy. “This policy will reduce '
            'dependency on imported fuels, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and '
            'improve air quality,” the minister said, adding that it will also '
            'foster economic growth through job creation in local '
            'manufacturing and the development of charging infrastructure. He '
            'claimed that the new EV policy would revolutionise Pakistan’s '
            'transport sector. The minister asserted that the reforms and '
            'achievements will address long-standing challenges in the power '
            'sector, and with increased economic activity, enhanced employment '

            '4,800 points (at the time of writing). \t\t\t The government '

            'policy rate of 22pc and the record Rs262bn earned from the '

            'consecutive month of surplus. While the improved trade balance '

            'central banks broke records in the first half of 2024, buying 483 '
            'tonnes of gold.  \t\t\t The year started with the monetary policy '
            'rate at 22pc; it ended at 13pc. The Monetary Policy Committee in '
            'the first meeting of 2024, was right when it predicted that '
            'headline inflation “will decline significantly in the second half '
            'of FY24 due to contained aggregate demand, easing supply '
            'constraints, moderation in international commodity prices and '
            'favourable base effect”. Inflation did hit a 78-month low at '
            '4.9pc in November, even if it does not feel like it. \t\t\t The '
            'PSX saw an increase in offerings in 2024, with the bourse '
            'witnessing seven IPOs (including two GEM Board offerings), '
            'compared to just one IPO in the previous year. The total amount '
            'raised from investors through the seven offerings in 2024 stood '

            'reached new highs. In FY24 (which ended in June), Pakistan '
            'exported rice worth $4bn compared to $2.15bn in FY23. While local '
            'favourable weather conditions helped, the surge was because of '
            'India’s more-than-a-year-long ban on rice exports to fulfil its '
            'domestic needs. After all, India, too, had an election year and a '
            'very large population to feed, and Pakistan benefitted. Recently, '
            'India lifted price controls and reopened rice exports, but '

            'in Pakistan, I have seen the country bask in global recognition '
            'for its many achievements. Pakistan still holds the record for '
            'the highest number of titles in the British Open, once considered '
            'the de facto world championship in squash. It dominated hockey '
            'for decades and still holds the highest number of World Cup '
            'titles. Who could forget the unbridled cricketing joy when '
            'Pakistan rose above adversity to lift the 1992 World Cup?  These '
            'successes put Pakistan on the international map for all the right '
            'reasons. Unfortunately, poor geopolitical choices turned these '
            'success stories into forgettable history.  Since 2015, '
            'Invest2Innovate has been tracking funding in Pakistan’s startup '
            'ecosystem. One decade later, the total funding has barely crossed '
            'the $1bn mark.  Despite low funding and infrastructure '
            'challenges, startups show immense potential and could re-write '
            'Pakistan’s future if properly supported  Much of this funding '
            'remains parked abroad, however. It is not because of startups or '
            'investors but rather due to a volatile exchange rate and '
            'challenging regulations, particularly for profit repatriation. '
            'These systemic issues highlight why fostering a startup ecosystem '
            'is crucial for Pakistan. Just as sports once brought the country '
            'global recognition, a thriving startup ecosystem holds the '
            'promise of achieving the same. Startups can attract international '
            'investors and boost the country’s brand image.  With the world’s '
            'fifth-largest population, Pakistan is ripe with opportunities. '
            'However, success stories need to inspire confidence among '
            'investors. It is impossible to ignore parallels with India, a '
            'neighbouring country that shares comparable market conditions but '
            'has surged far ahead in its startup journey.  According to the '
            'Confederation of Indian Industry, Indian startups are projected '
            'to create 50 million new jobs and add $1 trillion to the economy '
            'by 2030. In fact, 20-25pc of jobs created in India over the past '
            'decade have come from startups. This success is not just about '
            'numbers. It’s a testament to the transformative power of '
            'innovation-driven entrepreneurship. Pakistan’s startup ecosystem '
            'is still nascent, but positive signs are unmistakable. Companies '
            'like Foodpanda and Careem have gained a foothold, while homegrown '
            'startups like Bykea and Kravemart are making strides in the gig '
            'economy.  The startup ecosystem’s funding journey has been '
            'turbulent. The year 2024 began with the lowest funding levels in '
            'years, with only $1m recorded in the first half.  However, the '
            'latter half showed improvement, bringing the total funding to '
            '$42.5m by the end of 2024 — a 42.5pc drop compared to $74m '
            'recorded in 2023. Notably, 98pc of this funding came in the '
            'second half, which indicates cautious optimism going forward. '
            'According to the Pakistan Startup Ecosystem Report 2024, '
            'infrastructural issues — not founder capabilities — remain '
            'primary barriers. Startups face significant hurdles, such as '
            'unreliable electricity and connectivity, which hinder their '
            'operations and growth.  Internet shutdowns in response to '
            'political turmoil are wreaking havoc on startups, frustrating '
            'both investors and founders.   In 2024, fintech emerged as a '
            'dominant sector, securing $30.5m in funding and surpassing '
            'e-commerce for the first time. Looking ahead, cleantech and '
            'artificial intelligence (AI) are poised for significant growth.  '
            'Sarmayacar, a venture capital fund, has launched a Green Climate '
            'Fund with a cap of $40m, of which $15m has already been '
            'committed. E-mobility is gradually gaining traction, with '
            'electric bikes and buses heralding a slow but steady shift. '
            'Moreover, international markets are increasingly prioritising '
            'sustainability. Western countries and the European Union are '
            'raising concerns about imports with high carbon footprints, '
            'compelling Pakistani exporters to adapt. Cleantech startups have '
            'a pivotal role to play in helping businesses meet these demands. '
            'The potential of AI is equally transformative. Pakistan’s IT '
            'sector, despite macroeconomic challenges, is emerging as a driver '
            'of recovery and growth. By 2030, digital transformation could '
            'contribute up to Rs9.7tr in economic value, according to a report '
            'by Access Partnership. AI, in particular, could add $10bn-$20bn '
            'to Pakistan’s economy by 2030. Companies offering IT services are '
            'already seeing up to 30pc of their solutions incorporating AI, '
            'driven by international demand. Startups are not a silver bullet '
            'for Pakistan’s economic challenges, but they are a critical part '
            'of the solution. They bring innovation, create jobs and attract '
            'investment. More importantly, they offer a narrative shift — a '
            'story of resilience, creativity and potential. To unlock this '
            'potential, Pakistan needs to address its systemic challenges. '
            'This includes improving infrastructure, creating a more '
            'favourable regulatory environment, and fostering inclusivity, '
            'particularly for women entrepreneurs.  By doing so, the country '
            'can create an ecosystem where startups not only survive but '

            '“substantially below its earlier forecast range of '
            '11.5pc-13.5pc”, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).  '
            'Yearly average headline inflation for July-November 2024 fell to '
            '7.9pc, although inflation for the poor, as measured by the '

            '(effective till June 10, 2024) to 13pc (effective from December '
            '17, 2024) in five instalments.  However, it rightly remains '

            'inflation, calculated by subtracting food and energy inflation '
            'from overall inflation, at 9.7pc in November, “is proving to be '
            'sticky”, the SBP admitted in its recent monetary policy '
            'statement. This is where the government’s ongoing borrowing spree '

            'answers. Instead of policymakers helping farmers find answers, '
            'they have become part of the problem, confusing the community '
            'further by inaction, adjusting policies to foreign and '
            'international dictates rather than the local realities and '
            'refusing to enter into debate even on the most crucial issues. '
            '“We, the farmers, are at a loss of understanding how the present '
            'regime wants to deal with the sector,” says Abad Khan, a farmer '
            'and member of the Farmers’ Associates Pakistan. It is total '
            'policy paralysis. It started in early 2024 when the government '
            'announced the procurement price of wheat with much political '
            'funfair and then refused to purchase at the last moment, even '
            'after distributing gunny bags. Uncertainty reigns in the '
            'agriculture sector as farmers reel from half-backed policies, '
            'zero clarity from lawmakers, and a steadily worsening climate '
            'crisis This massive policy shift came abruptly, without any '
            'debate at any level — farmers, government, and the media — and no '
            'one discussed it or saw it coming, but it came. For farmers, the '
            'result was crushing; they lost over 30 per cent of their income '
            'and livelihood overnight. Even then, the government refused to '
            'explain its policy position. Wheat is sown yet again, without any '
            'support price or policy explainer. This insensitive attitude, '
            'where the government is not ready to explain, let alone justify, '
            'its policy position despite the devastating blow to farmers, '
            'augurs hardly well for all those connected to this crop, Mr Khan '
            'laments. “Taking a cue from the government, sugar millers have '
            'started crushing this season without telling anyone what the '
            'price of cane is. After a staple crop, a cash crop is being dealt '
            'with the same way, and farmers are calculating and suffering the '
            'cost of policy reversals without knowing what comes next. “The '
            'governments, both national and provincial, should at least tell '
            'farmers what they want to do to them. Instead of cosmetic steps '
            'like solarising tubewells and subsidising tractors, the '
            'government should deal with the crucial policy issues,” he added. '
            '‘The governments, both national and provincial, should  deal with '
            'crucial policy issues, instead of taking cosmetic steps like '
            'solarising tubewells and subsidising tractors’ Goaded by the '
            'International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Punjab government is '
            'toying with the idea of changing the taxation regime in the '
            'province, where 80pc of agriculture takes place. Though no one '
            'knows for sure the details of the new regime, leaked media '
            'reports suggest its conversion from revenue to income-based and '
            'divide it into five slabs — with the highest income slab (over '
            'Rs4.8 million) costing 45pc tax. This naturally causes anxiety '
            'among farmers, who do not know what awaits them in 2025, '
            'especially when some reports suggest it would be slapped with a '
            'retrospective effect. “One should not forget that there is '
            'dreadful confusion,” claims Farooq Ahmad Bajwa, a lawyer and '
            'president of the Basmati Growers Association. Despite these '
            'rumours and different versions of the proposed regimes, which '
            'have been doing rounds in the media for the last six months, no '
            'one is bothered to own or disown these reports; there is complete '
            'silence on the part of the government. As per reports, it may '
            'also be double taxation, cast to the owners and lessees — both '
            'are supposed to show income from the same land, with the owner as '
            'beneficiary and the absentee farmer and lessee as the actual one. '
            '“Once implemented, this regime would kill farmers financially if '
            'tax is collected. If not, the IMF would strangulate the state. '
            'The most tragic part is that the government is not ready to '
            'explain its position despite demoralising theories about its '
            'potential act. It is economically and politically harmful for the '
            'government to think that it can leave farmers hanging, take '
            'abrupt and unexplained decisions and let growers adjust to their '
            'shocking effects — as has happened in the case of wheat and '
            'cane.” Climate change, according to farmers, is now a verifiable '
            'agricultural phenomenon; its 2024 damages can now be calculated '
            'mathematically. This year, among other factors, climate caught '
            'crops like rice, maize, cotton and sesame at the wrong and '
            'crucial times and caused 35-65pc production losses. Sesame, which '
            'saw its acreage expanding from 600,000 acres to 1.7m acres in the '
            'last two years, experienced 65pc loss. Cotton lost 35pc, rice '
            'losses stand at 30pc and so is that of maize. No doubt, these '
            'crops were weak on nutrients because of the financial impact of '
            'wheat loss early this year, but beneficial weather could have '
            'helped them regain strength. Instead, it afflicted its own '
            'losses, dragging the entire production cycle down and multiplying '
            'ruinous losses. “The policy response? None; instead, we got '
            'elegiac sermons. The government should come up with a clear '
            'policy response, broken into milestones and fiscal allocations,” '
            'demands Dr Iqrar A Khan, former vice-chancellor of Agriculture '
            'University and celebrated academic of the sector. It can neither '
            'be wished away nor would delayed response help. Rather, losses '
            'would multiply and make agriculture even more uncertain," Dr Khan '
            'warns.',

            'clients have seen a major shift as questions about Pakistan '
            'transcend small talk and directly relate to the ability to '
            'deliver tasks. It’s no longer the theoretical “Is it safe to '

            'uncertainty, dearth of capital and talent scarcity. Now, there’s '
            'another solid and needless contender to the list — one that '
            'shakes up the most fundamental building block. According to '
            'Top10VPN, which collects and aggregates data on internet '
            'disruptions around the globe, Pakistan ranked second by the '
            'duration of shutdowns in 2024 at 1,861 hours behind only Myanmar '
            '— which is hardly the country we should aspire to. This cost us '
            'an estimated $351 million, again second only to our South Asian '
            'peer. Where we really outshined everyone was the scale: at almost '
            '83m users, the magnitude of our ‘shenanigans’ had no parallel and '
            'alone accounted for over 40 per cent of the top 15 most '
            'vulnerable countries. Not only that, but we also significantly '
            'upped our own performance with the duration of internet shutdowns '
            'surging 619pc from 259 hours in 2023 — rising up five notches '
            'from seventh place globally. As a result, accompanying costs also '
            'shot up by an additional $114m. Other trade bodies and '
            'organisations have presented their own numbers, with the Pakistan '
            'Software House Association claiming a loss of $1m for each hour '
            'of internet outage. Amidst the recurring balance of payments '
            'crisis Pakistan faced, the information and communication sector '
            'has emerged as a strong source of dollars. In 11MCY24, it has '
            'contributed $3.3 billion — behind only the textile and food '
            'group. Particularly within services, it’s the only category '
            'consistently registering a surplus. Do internet shutdowns wipe '
            'this off? Obviously not, but they raise the cost of operations '
            'for local tech companies, which always stings. More importantly, '
            'it discourages them from bringing back any more forex than '
            'absolutely needed. This further exacerbates the problem of '
            'undocumented exports, which by some estimates equal the '
            'officially recorded figure. As long as the latter is showing '
            'healthy growth, those in power don’t really give much regard to '
            'the former since it can’t be measured anyway. However, what can '
            'be measured is the slowdown in the usage of the internet in '
            'Pakistan. According to Cloudflare, the country has seen an annual '
            'decline in web traffic for most of 2024. In fact, during the '
            'first 11 months, there were a total of 30 odd days where the '
            'percentage change was not in the red. Over this period, our peak '
            'growth was 3pc, compared to the global 17pc — despite the '
            'significant differences in respective bases. Keep in mind that '
            'when we get the internet, the quality is not exactly great. The '
            'average download speed in Pakistan was just around 22MBps, '
            'lagging well behind peers like the Philippines (97MBps), '
            'Bangladesh (37MBps) and Indonesia (31MBps). Secondly, such '
            'episodes do irreparable damage to the confidence of young, '
            'talented Pakistanis. Other than family, what incentive do they '
            'have to stay behind? After all, the value of their hard-earned '
            'money has plunged to less than half over the last few years while '
            'every good has become dearer. There weren’t too many rights being '

            'residence in Judgewala Chak, Kamalia, on Sunday, the minister '

            'stood at $30.2 billion in the last fiscal year, are projected to '
            'exceed $35bn in the current fiscal year. Stressing the importance '
            'of self-reliance, he urged moving away from dependency on '
            'external aid. Mr Aurangzeb acknowledged that there are political '
            'differences but stressed that everyone should join hands for the '
            'vast interest of the country and called for a “ ”. “We have '
            'progressed through our own efforts, not by relying on anyone,” he '

            'economy towards further improvement in the next year. He also '

            'activity. “There is no magic wand to fix everything instantly. We '

            'Aurangzeb emphasised the need for policymakers to directly engage '
            'with the public and stakeholders. “We will not sit idle in '
            'Islamabad. We are visiting cities to seek input from traders and '
            'citizens,” he said. The minister reiterated that Pakistan '
            'couldn’t rely on charity to run its economy. While charity can '
            'support educational and healthcare institutions, it couldn’t '
            'sustain a nation, he added. He stressed the need to revitalise '
            'key sectors, including agriculture, IT, and poultry, identifying '
            'agriculture and IT as the twin sectors that drive Pakistan’s '
            'sustainable economic growth. The minister proposed the '
            'privatisation of loss-making state-owned enterprises and '
            'suggested involving the private sector to manage underperforming '

            'individuals. He noted that the government is working to increase '

            'simplify the taxation regime, digitise processes and minimise '
            'human intervention. Mr Aurangzeb also noted that research '
            'institutions had failed to achieve the desired results in '
            'agriculture, attributing the inefficiency to the allocation of '
            '80pc of their budgets towards salaries, leaving only 20pc for '
            'research. He also mentioned the increase in consumption of cement '
            'and fertiliser, as well as a 58pc surge in auto sales, as '
            'indicators of the government’s prudent policies. On energy, he '

            'shoulders The trend virtually converted banks into investment '
            'companies, making the government ignore the private sector’s need '
            'for cash.      Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and '
            'agriculture are the backbone of our economy. Contributing 40pc to '
            'the GDP, SMEs constitute nearly 90 per cent of all private '
            'enterprises in Pakistan, generate 30pc in export earnings and '

            'research report on banking in Pakistan, less than three per cent '
            'of the five million enterprises have borrowed from banks. This '
            'fact is enough to gauge the banking sector’s enthusiasm for '
            'taking part in the nation’s economic growth. The government never '
            'came up with a policy to boost a sector which accounts for 40pc '
            'of the GDP and provides jobs to one-third of the workforce. '
            'According to a recent   compiled by the United Nations '
            'Development Programme, 95 million Pakistanis live below the '
            'poverty line. The situation is alarming, but the government and '
            'banks are not ready to address this issue. The government is '

            'Dec 31 this year, the ADR has now jumped to 50 per cent. This '
            'decision suddenly changed the banks’ lending trend over the last '
            'couple of months. Lending to the private sector and non-bank '
            'financial institutions (NBFIs) has improved. The ADR has been '
            'gradually contracting and stood at 41pc in December last year and '
            'at 37pc in June this year. Lending to the private sector '
            'represented 12pc of GDP (Dec 2023). The lower ADR did not match '
            'the high growth in deposits. These grew by 24pc, reaching Rs 29.1 '

            'rose by 4pc to Rs13 trillion, much lower than the 16pc growth '

            '(although some subsequent adjustments were recorded to address '
            'ADR tax implications). A significant expansion of 42pc was noted '

            'historic importance, access to affordable growth capital remains '
            'restrictive. Financing to these critical sectors has been '
            'declining over the years. The present government depends largely '
            'on agriculture for economic expansion since the   (LSM) sector is '
            'still showing negative growth. The LSM sector recorded a '
            'contraction of 0.76pc during the first quarter (July-September '
            '2024) of FY 25, reflecting mixed trends across industries, '

            'Statistics (PBS). Some official reports show that   will remain '
            'short of the target by at least 30pc. At the same time, wheat and '
            'other crops are not showing bumper production either. The '
            'situation points to another possible contraction of GDP as both '
            'the LSM and agriculture sectors are far below the target. Some '
            'banking analysts said the LSM could not borrow due to a '
            'record-high interest rate of 22pc during the entire fiscal year '
            'FY24 while banks do not bother about SMEs. Since investments went '
            'up to 94pc by June 2024, the banks’ contribution to economic '

            'often through dangerous and unco\xadnventional routes across '
            'Balochistan. In 2023 as many as 8,272 Pakistanis were arrested in '

            'Panjgur, Kech, and Gwadar — share borders with Iran, making them '
            'key areas for illegal migration attempts. Between 2020 and 2024, '
            'over 62,000 Pakistani citizens, primarily from Pun\xadjab, were '
            'arrested for illegally entering Iran from Pakistan. Over the past '
            'one and a half years, Iran has deported more than 5,000 '
            'Pakistanis. The federal government recently made a decision to '
            'block the passports of Pakistani citizens involved in illegal '
            'migration. A few days ago, the passports of 2,470 Pakistanis '
            'involved in allegedly drug-related crimes in the UAE were '
            'blocked.      In November, the Pakistani government began '
            'blocking passports of 1,500 Pakistanis deported from Iraq, with '
            'an initial decision to block the passports of 50 individuals for '
            'seven years. According to the Ministry of Interior, over 1,500 '
            'Pakistani citizens were deported from Iraq in the past six '
            'months, and their passports will also be blocked. In October, the '
            'Pakistan government blocked passports of 4,000 Pakistanis '
            'detained in Saudi Arabia. They were arrested for crimes such as '
            'begging in Saudi Arabia. The passports of these 4,000 Pakistani '
            'citizens have been blocked for 7 years, with more than 60 per '
            'cent of them coming from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For a '
            'long time, citizens from Pakistan and Afghanistan have been '
            'attempting to reach European countries through these routes in '
            'Balochistan. However, a large number of them get arrested in '
            'Iran. Officials say that in the past, a large number of people '
            'used to enter Iran from Kech and Gwadar, but due to militant '
            'attacks in those areas, most of them now use the routes of Chagai '
            'and Washuk for the purpose. While many people are arrested during '
            'this journey, several also lose their lives due to the hardships '

            'rollicking cameo with the bat by Mitchell Hay saw New Zealand '
            'beat Sri Lanka to wrap up their Twenty20 series with a game to '
            'spare at Mount Maunganui on Monday. New Zealand made 186-5 in '
            'their 20 overs, with player-of-the-match Hay cracking an unbeaten '
            '41 from 19 deliveries. Sri Lanka in reply were all out for 141 '
            'with Duffy taking four wickets for a miserly 15 runs, including '
            'the tourists’ top scorers Kusal Perera for 48 and Pathum Nissanka '
            'for 37. “I said at the start whoever could use the wind the best '
            'would do pretty well, and we were able to do that with the bat,” '
            'New Zealand captain Mitchell Santer said, while also praising '
            'Duffy’s bowling. “Every time I bring him back he gets a pole. '
            '“The best way to slow a run rate down is to take wickets and '
            'that’s what we were able to do in the middle.” The 45-run '
            'victory, following their eight-run win on Saturday put New '
            'Zealand 2-0 up in the three-match series. “I’m really '
            'disappointed with the results,” Sri Lankan captain Charith '
            'Asalanka said, adding his side needed to adapt more quickly to '
            'New Zealand pitches. “They’re more bouncy than at home, that’s '
            'the main thing, and we have to adjust to that. At the same time '
            'they (New Zealand) were brilliant.” Sri Lanka started their run '
            'race cautiously with eight off the first two overs before '
            'Nissanka launched into New Zealand’s strike bowler Matt Henry, '
            'taking 16 off his next over. But, no sooner had Sri Lanka started '
            'to fire, Santner came into the attack into the fifth over and '
            'removed Kusal Mendis for 10 with his first delivery. Nissanka and '
            'Perera had lifted the score to 71 by the 10th over when Duffy, '
            'who turned the first game in New Zealand’s favour, again made a '
            'crucial breakthrough. A slower delivery to Nissanka was scooped '
            'to Henry at fine leg and the Sri Lankan talisman was gone for 37. '
            'When Perera was bowled at the start of the 16th over it was the '
            'begining of the end for Sri Lanka as their last seven wickets '
            'fell for just 14 runs. New Zealand, who again lost the toss and '
            'were told to bat first, produced a steady performance until Hay '
            'opened up with three overs remaining. In the final 18 deliveries '
            'New Zealand scored 43 runs, 35 of them coming from Hay as he '
            'atoned for his first-ball duck in game one. After New Zealand '
            'lost Rachin Ravindra for just one early, Tim Robinson and Mark '
            'Chapman put on 69 for the second wicket. But in the 10th over, '

 'content': 'KARACHI: The commissioner of Karachi has reduced the prices of '
            'various varieties of flour but retailers, instead of implementing '
            'the new rates, are charging more from consumers.   On December '
            '26, the wholesale and retail prices of flour No2.5 were reduced '
            'from Rs90 and Rs94 to Rs85 and Rs89 per kg.   The flour No2.5 is '
            'the one which is mostly used by tandoor operators. The price '
            'reduction was Rs5 per kg.   The new wholesale and retail rates of '
            'fine flour have been notified at Rs92 and Rs96 per kg as compared '
            'to Rs95 and Rs99 per kg, respectively.   Despite recent cuts, '
            'consumers are still paying higher prices for different wheat '
            'flour varieties   Retail chakki flour price has been cut by Rs10 '
            'to Rs105 per kg.   Surprisingly, the December 26 notification '
            'does not carry the ex-mill rates of flour No2.5 and fine flours, '
            'while the same were prominent in the previous lists.   On June 5, '
            '2024, wholesale and retail rates of flour No2.5 were Rs91 and '
            'Rs95 per kg. The wholesale and retail rates of fine flour were '
            'Rs95 and Rs100 per kg, while chakki flour retail rate was Rs115 '
            'per kg.   A market survey revealed that consumers were paying '
            'Rs110-120 per kg for flour No2.5 and fine flour, showing a '
            'massive price difference between the official and market rates.   '
            '“One of the reasons of retailers’ fleecing consumers is lack of '
            'display of official price lists at retail shops,” said Karachi '
            'Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA) chairman Rauf Ibrahim.   '
            'He said it was the government’s responsibility to publish price '
            'list at mass level instead of posting the list on social media.   '
            'In addition to the absence of a price list, the officials of the '
            'city government also did not pay any visit to markets to impose '
            'fines on shopkeepers for overcharging, he added.   He said that '
            'the commissioner and his team should also pay visits to wholesale '
            'markets and ensure official price implementation.   “Keeping in '
            'view the local and imported wheat rates, which are Rs74 and Rs70 '
            'per kg, respectively, official prices of various flour varieties '
            'can be further cut by Rs2 per kg,” he suggested.   Prior to the '
            'new price list which was issued on December 26, the commissioner '
            'of Karachi took more than six months to announce flour rates on '
            'December 17.   Amid no price fixing for branded flour varieties, '
            'the 5kg Ashrafi and Bake Parlour fine flour bag is available at '
            'Rs630 while 5kg chakki branded flour bag is selling at Rs600.   '
            'Grocery rates   While no retailers have been seen displaying the '
            'official price list of vegetables at their shops, consumers are '
            'also seeing huge price differences in other items.   For example, '
            'the official rates of new potato and onion are Rs92 but they are '
            'available at Rs100-150 per kg in the markets.   Tomato is selling '
            'at Rs200-220 per kg as against the official rate of Rs173 per '
            'kg.   The official rate of sugar is fixed at Rs125 per kg while '
            'retailers are selling the sweetener at Rs135-145 per kg.   The '
            'market retail rates of masoor, moong, mash and gram pulse are '
            'Rs280-320, Rs330-340, Rs440-520 and Rs360-420 per kg as against '
            'their official rates of Rs262, Rs325, Rs425 and Rs355 per kg, '
            'respectively.   Mutton is selling at Rs2,200-2,400 as against its '

            'project. A few months ago, the contractor had informed the CDA '
            'that inadequate and piecemeal funding was one of the main reasons '
            'for the delay in work. Only 35pc progress made as officials blame '
            'paucity of funds for delay The NLC also called for an '
            'implementation of the price adjustment formula approved by the '
            'Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and the Executive Committee of '
            'the National Economic Committee (Ecnec) in 2023. For this mega '
            'project, the government in fiscal year 2024-25 earmarked only '
            'Rs400 million, which showed that the government was not '
            'interested in getting this project completed in this fiscal year. '
            'Out of the allocated Rs 400 million, only Rs 140 million was '
            'released during the first two quarters of this fiscal year. The '
            'project was started by the PTI government. Initially, the '
            'government had earmarked over Rs1 billion, but in the fiscal year '
            '2022-23 only Rs350 million were set aside for it. Then the PDM '
            'government released Rs1.3 billion, and in the fiscal year 2023-24 '
            'only Rs400 million were earmarked. Out of it, during the first '
            'two quarters, Rs 140 million was released. Under the first phase '
            'of the project, a 5km road is being constructed from the Katarian '
            'Bridge on Karnal Sher Khan Road to the Srinagar Highway near the '
            'intersection of the G-9 and G-10 sectors in the federal capital. '
            'In the second phase, the avenue will be constructed from the '
            'Srinagar Highway to Margalla Road. The 10th Avenue is part of the '
            'city’s master plan, which mandates the construction of an avenue '
            'after every sector, just like the 7th Avenue between sectors G-6 '
            'and G-7, Faisal Avenue between G-7 and G-8, and 9th Avenue '
            'between G-8 and G-9. As the 10th Avenue project is stuck, the '
            'proposed 11th Avenue project has yet to be started. '
            'Interestingly, PM Shehbaz Sharif, during his first stint last '
            'year, had laid the foundation stone of 11th Avenue, but that '
            'project has not started yet, except for a two-kilometre portion '
            'near Margalla Road, which is known as Iran Avenue.',

            'Organ\xadisation (WMO) said in a report released on Monday. The '

            'ten hottest years on record have happened in the last ten years, '
            'including 2024,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in '
            'his New Year message. “This is climate breakdown — in real time. '
            'We must exit this road to ruin — and we have no time to lose. In '
            '2025, countries must put the world on a safer path by '
            'dramatically slashing emissions, and supporting the transition to '
            'a renewable future,” he said. WMO report says outgoing year set '

            'of extreme weather events,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo '
            'said. “This year we saw record-breaking rainfall and flooding '
            'events and terrible loss of life in so many countries, causing '
            'heartbreak to communities on every continent. Tropical cyclones '
            'caused a terrible human and economic toll, most recently in the '
            'French overseas department of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean. '
            'Intense heat scorched dozens of countries, with temperatures '
            'topping 50 °C on a number of occasions. Wildfires wreaked '

{'author': 'Aleezeh Fatima',
 'category': None,
 'content': 'I recently watched   at home due to the ongoing boycott and '
            'realised it had been a long time since I sat down and dedicated '
            'time to watch a movie. It took me back to when I was eight, '
            'holding my dad’s hand as we bought samosas outside Venus cinema, '
            'excited to watch a regional film. The movie likely had a few loud '
            'songs and fight scenes, with no real plot or story development, '
            'but for me, it’s steeped in nostalgia. As a Gen Z kid born in '
            '2000, I grew up watching Salman Khan’s movies in cinemas every '
            'Eid — it was a family tradition. While we’ve kept this tradition '
            'alive through an LED screen where I now show my sisters the '
            'films, the culture of going to the cinema has long faded.      '
            'Capri, once a go-to spot for middle-class families, closed long '
            'ago. Cinepax, located at the prime Water Pump location, also shut '
            'its doors, and more recently, Atrium Cinema followed suit as '
            'footfall wasn’t what it once was, and in the words of the owner, '
            '“It is less expensive to shut a cinema in Pakistan than to keep '
            'running it.” “My family built Capri from the ground up, and we '
            'ran it for a solid 56 years,” Capri’s owner Farrukh Rauf told  . '
            'Now, the cinema’s building stands as a haunting reminder of what '
            'it once was, remnants of old movie posters covered with a layer '
            'of dust lining the corridors, evidence of a place that once '
            'buzzed with life. “Our cinema catered to people like a husband '
            'and wife who travelled by motorbike, looking to enjoy a movie '
            'within a Rs1,000 budget. With two tickets priced under Rs800 and '
            'food for two easily bought for Rs200, it made watching a film an '
            'affordable and enjoyable experience,” he explained.      Movie '
            'tickets no longer cost that much. For the past five years, the '
            'far flashier Nueplex Cinema has been charging between Rs800 and '
            'Rs1,000 for standard cinema seats for digital 2D movies. Back in '
            '2021, a single ticket cost around Rs700, and when you factor in '
            'the cost of snacks, you would have spent at least Rs1,500 on a '
            'single movie for one person, which isn’t exactly budget friendly. '
            'Capri Cinema ceased operations in June 2023, and according to '
            'Rauf, ticket prices remained between Rs200, Rs300, and at most '
            'Rs400 until the very end. Even as electricity rates rose, the '
            'staff tried their best to keep the cinema open for the public.\n'
            '“However, over time, it became nearly impossible because '
            'electricity rates were increasing every few months. As a cinema '
            'owner, I had to recover at least 50 per cent of the costs I was '
            'putting in. Against our will, we had to raise ticket prices, '
            'which, unsurprisingly, significantly impacted footfall,” he '
            'explained. Nadeem Mandviwalla, the owner of Atrium Cinemas in '
            'Karachi and Centaurus Cinemas in Islamabad, believes that closing '
            'a cinema is more cost effective than keeping it operational. '
            '“With 44 years in the industry, I can confidently say that due to '
            'restrictions and lack of acknowledgment, cinemas in Pakistan have '
            'never progressed.” “My most vivid memory from childhood and '
            'adolescence was rebelling by watching films every Thursday. I '
            'would argue with my parents and go watch the latest movies '
            'playing at the cinema. This was part of our culture,” Asiya Bibi '
            'told me as she prepared fresh paan. She is a film enthusiast and '
            'still gushes over her massive crush on Pakistan’s “chocolate '
            'hero” Waheed Murad. Her Saturday routine includes having her '
            'grandchildren sit with her to listen to songs like ‘Ye Ada Ye '
            'Naaz Ye Andaz Aapka’ and ‘Mujhe Tum Nazar Se Gira Toh Rahe '
            'Ho.’      “Kids these days might think the films from our time '
            'were silly, but romance without touch and the beauty captured in '
            'a few simple shots is unmatched,” she mused.\n'
            'Since 1948, Pakistan has produced over 14,000 Urdu feature films, '
            'more than 10,000 in Punjabi, over 8,000 in Pashto, around 4,000 '
            'in Sindhi, and 1,000 in Balochi. The first film produced on what '
            'is now Pakistani soil was  , directed by Abdur Rashid Kardar in '
            'Lahore in 1929. Pakistan’s first post-independence film,  , was '
            'directed by Daud Chand in 1948. “My favourite was Nadeem, and I '
            'became a fan right after I saw   with my mother in the cinema. I '
            'was very young, I can’t remember how old I was, but it was the '
            'first time my mother wrapped me in a burqa since it was '
            'considered improper for women to visit the cinema back then,” '
            'recalled Nosheen Attaullah, a mother of two. “In 1968, the '
            'cinemas were dominated by male audiences mostly. Women would be '
            'there, but they’d be accompanied by the men of their families. '
            'Very rarely would we see women coming to cinemas themselves,” '
            'Rauf said.      He explained how cinema equipment was highly '
            'complex back then, and transporting it to cinema halls was even '
            'more challenging. Watching a film was a great feat in itself. '
            '“Most films were in black and white, so we had to ensure '
            'colour-corrected screens were used. The projectors were imported '
            'and required frequent cleaning, which added to the cost,” he '
            'said. From the 90s to well into the 2000s, the craze for '
            'Bollywood films brought audiences back to cinemas. Shah Rukh '
            'Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, and other popular '
            'heroes drew audiences, particularly women, to the theatres in '
            'droves. “When I took charge of the cinemas, female footfall was '
            'very low, and that was something I aimed to change. I began '
            'revitalising the cinema by making it safer, creating separate '
            'spaces, and charging less for tickets. That’s when women started '
            'coming in,” Rauf told  .      By the end of the 90s and the start '
            'of the 2000s, going to the cinema was no longer a major taboo. '
            'Women may not have felt safe enough to visit male-dominated '
            'spaces like Venus Cinema in Karachi’s Liaquatabad but they did go '
            'to Prince, Shama, Bambino, and Capri cinemas, often accompanied '
            'by male family members or friends. “I saw Aamir Khan in   and '
            'after that, I couldn’t miss any of his films. I didn’t have any '
            'restrictions on going to the cinema, but my friend Faria, who was '
            'also a huge fan, did. So, we’d sneak out from college to catch a '
            'movie at least once a month,” giggled 55-year-old Khursheed. “But '
            'over time, when her mother became a Shah Rukh Khan fan herself, '
            'we had one more person to argue with about which film to watch,” '
            'she added. The culture of watching Bollywood movies continued for '
            'another three generations. Pakistan began   films in 1962, with '
            'further restrictions imposed in 1979 when General Ziaul Haq set '
            'the country on a course of Islamisation, with far stricter '
            'censorship rules. Although a ban on Indian films and media had '
            'existed since 1965, it was inconsistently enforced. It was   for '
            'two films —\xa0  and  —\xa0 in 2006.      In 2008, the ban was   '
            'and then reimposed in 2016 following the Uri attacks and '
            '‘surgical strikes’ along the Line of Control. In 2017, the   by '
            'then premier Nawaz Sharif’s government. One of the conditions of '
            'the reinstatement was that cinemas in Pakistan were to equally '
            'divide screen time between Indian and Pakistani films. The ban on '
            'Indian films was   in 2019. For Rauf, the ban on Bollywood lead '
            'to the start of cinema culture’s decline. But it wasn’t just '
            'Bollywood films being   —\xa0other films experienced periodic '
            'bans as well. Tom Hanks’   was   after Pakistani Christians '
            'protested its blasphemous content. In 2010, the government   '
            'Bollywood film   starring singer Ali Zafar out of concern that it '
            'may spark terrorist attacks due to the name. Despite these '
            'individual bans, Bollywood movies thrived in Pakistan '
            'pre-2019.    drew a huge turnout, with high school kids flocking '
            'to cinemas, fantasising about having classmates like Alia Bhatt, '
            'Siddharth Malhotra, and Varun Dhawan. Similarly,   saw a great '
            'response.      But by  , Bollywood films were completely banned '
            'and the government launched a   on the sale of Indian films in '
            'solidarity with Kashmir. “When Bollywood films were completely '
            'banned, cinema attendance saw a great decline. The positive side '
            'was that by then, Pakistani cinema was producing [high] quality '
            'films.   managed to attract audiences, and people were eager to '
            'support local cinema, often watching even subpar films,” '
            'Mandviwalla said. He told   he asked the PTA why cinemas couldn’t '
            'screen Indian content, especially when platforms like Netflix and '
            'Amazon Prime, approved by the board, were already streaming it '
            'and it was popular with audiences. “We know there’s a shortage of '
            'our own content, so why can’t we show it in cinemas?” he asked. '
            '“If you take a look at   and the business it [generated], you’d '
            'know that audiences will come back to the cinemas if you bring '
            'them a good film. In 2007, the cinema had a Rs10 million market — '
            'within 11 years, the market went from Rs10 million to Rs500 '
            'million. This was the time when Pakistan was generating its own '
            'content and the government allowed popular films to run in '
            'cinemas,” he explained.      2022’s   became the   Punjabi film '
            'of all time. That year, the film   back to cinemas, something '
            'that was initially credited to its star-studded cast featuring '
            'two of Pakistan’s biggest stars, Mahira Khan and Fawad Khan. '
            'After the glitz wore off, people realised the movie’s '
            'cinematography, story and character development were as, if not '
            'more, compelling as its stars. “Pakistani film culture is a mixed '
            'one and hasn’t fully developed its own identity yet. It has been '
            'influenced by many industries, and is still trying to carve out '
            'its own through its content,” said Fizza Ali Meerza, producer '
            'of   and  . Meerza compared the cinema industry’s trajectory to '
            'that of the country. “Cinema boomed when the country boomed, and '
            'it declined when the country went down,” she said.      “I '
            'started working in the media in 2001 as a production assistant, '
            'and back then everyone was passionate about making films. People '
            'were ‘thinking’ films even if they did not know how to execute '
            'what they were thinking,” she recalled. Cinema boomed in the 70s, '
            'said Meerza, declined in the 80s and sustained itself through the '
            '90s. “Editing was still manual, while the rest of the world, '
            'including Indian cinema, was shifting to digital. At one point, '
            'the quality of Indian films could be compared to Hollywood, but '
            'you couldn’t say the same about Pakistani films,” she said. “The '
            'point is, the cinema industry is not recognised by the '
            'government, and realistically, it’s not feasible in a country '
            'without a film board or insurance policies. I’ve met five '
            'ministers in my career, and I can tell you, we’re not recognised '
            'as an industry,” the producer said. To Meerza, filmmaking is '
            'treated as a hobby in Pakistan. “At this point, the notion of '
            '‘supporting Pakistani cinema’ is annoying to me. There are so '
            'many causes to support in Pakistan, and film is not a charity. If '
            'we want support, we’re supposed to make good films. It’s my job '
            'to produce the best content, and I’m not doing anyone a favour,” '
            'she said.      Director Salman Noorani believes that making a '
            'feature film in Pakistan is not a sustainable investment. “As a '
            'striving filmmaker and someone in the field, I don’t think this '
            'is a viable business. There is no revenue model, and 90 to 95pc '
            'of films are either flops or rarely achieve a breakthrough. So, '
            'all in all, it’s not worth your time and energy to make a film in '
            'Pakistan.” He also highlighted the impact of OTT platforms on '
            'diminishing attention spans, noting that people now prefer '
            'watching content on their TV screens rather than making the '
            'effort to visit cinemas. “I might watch a slow burn movie, but '
            'even my attention span is that of an Instagram reel,” he '
            'chuckled. An important aspect of the cinema industry that is '
            'often overlooked is the role of film journalists, who sit through '
            'movies in cinemas to provide reviews. Thanks to them, the public '
            'can save money by skipping not-so-great films. “I am named after '
            'a film, so it’s literally in my genes. When I was younger, I '
            'would go to Atrium to watch a film every Sunday; it was a family '
            'activity. We would have brief discussions about whatever movie we '
            'had watched. That experience was unmatched,” recalled Simran '
            'Siraj, an entertainment and culture journalist. “Cinema these '
            'days, especially Pakistani cinema, fails to produce content '
            'relatable to even a single age group. There are no releases '
            'outside of Eid, and it goes flat throughout the year.” She '
            'attributed this to the frequency with which content is released, '
            'poorly thought out storylines, lack of research and lack of '
            'emotionally striking moments.      Sajeer Sheikh, who has '
            'reviewed films for  , believes cinema in Pakistan is heavily '
            'politicised. “When I say that Pakistani cinema is politicised, I '
            'mean that there are various levels of politics at play. Bollywood '
            'is, of course, highly politicised as well and we’ve seen '
            'jingoistic narratives come out as a result, as well as religious '
            'sentiments being hurt with films like   where a   was placed on '
            'Deepika [Padukone’s] head,” she said. “It’s a similar but far '
            'more zeroed in approach in Pakistan, where anything can be taken '
            'out of context and manipulated to further one’s agenda. For '
            'instance, the calls for   of Fawad Khan in   when he had nothing '
            'to do with the homosexuality arc, the   on   and heavy '
            'allegations against Sarmad Khoosat that led to an entire '
            'fully-made film never being released in cinemas,” she added. A '
            'fresh perspective was offered by Kamran Javaid, a journalist who '
            'has been reviewing films for over 20 years in  , and believes '
            'that inflation has nothing to do with cinema culture’s '
            'decline.      “Inflation is not the problem. People often compare '
            'cinema with eating out. When you do the math, eating out is just '
            'as expensive, if not more. You’re paying for fuel in either case, '
            'the quality of food or the quality of the film will always be '
            'subjective — even in tried and tested restaurants, the quality of '
            'food would go up or down, so it’s a risk either way,” he said. '
            '“The one thing that distinguishes film from food is the '
            'entertainment value — and even then, I’ve seen people enjoy bad '
            'movies. The mediocre ones are the real problem. How does one '
            'enjoy anything mediocre? Pakistan makes mediocre [films] by the '
            'dozen every year, and herein lies the problem,” he explained. '
            '“People stay away from the movies because they offer little '
            'distinction from television. The actors are the same, the genres '
            'are limited to comedy and familial drama, and everyone shoots '
            'shallow depth of field — out of focus backgrounds — and labels '
            'them ‘cinematic’, and yet makes the same editorial and '
            'storytelling blunders. Why, pray tell, would the audience give '
            'today’s cinema a chance for its indistinguishability?” he asked. '
            'Contrary to popular (millennial and boomer) belief, most Gen Z '
            'viewers haven’t truly had the chance to experience traditional '
            'cinema culture. Going to the cinema has become less accessible '
            'due to financial constraints —\xa0people’s salaries just can’t '
            'compete with rising expenses — and the rise of OTT platforms. It '
            'makes more sense to stay in on a Saturday night and watch '
            'something on a laptop than to drive across the city just to see a '
            'movie. They’re often told they don’t know what “real films” are, '
            'and many agree that they’re missing out.      “Art imitates life, '
            'and what I believe is lacking in today’s Pakistani cinema is the '
            'portrayal of relatable subjects or harsh realities, like the case '
            'of Javed Iqbal, which we might not be ready to confront. That’s '
            'why films like these end up getting  ,” said cinema enthusiast '
            'Waqar Hussain. Abu Aleeha’s  , based on the notorious serial '
            'killer who murdered 100 young boys in Lahore and sent evidence of '
            'his crimes to the media and police in 1999, was banned a day '
            'before its release. “Our films are heavily influenced by the '
            'drama industry, which, to be fair, did work to some extent at '
            'first. However, it’s clearly no longer effective, which is why '
            'we’re not seeing a revival. We need to evolve, and that evolution '
            'needs to happen quickly,” said Maira Pasha, a film enthusiast and '
            'promotions executive of the feature film  . “I’ll be honest — I '
            'stopped going to the cinema because I simply can’t afford it,” '
            'said Saad, an accountant with a passion for filmmaking. “While '
            'I’d love to spend on films, my limited income doesn’t allow me to '
            'indulge in that passion.” Zoya, a film student at Indus Valley '
            'School of Art and Architecture in Karachi, shared these views. “I '
            'love cinema and used to save every penny to watch a film,” she '
            'said. “I’m studying on financial aid and remain passionate about '
            'film, but I just can’t afford it anymore. My daily commute now '
            'costs less than a trip to the cinema.”      The debate about what '
            'kind of films to produce and what constitutes high-quality '
            'content feels endless. Everyone has a different opinion and that '
            'variety of opinion is reflected in the variety of content '
            'produced — whether it’s Marvel and DC blockbusters or films '
            'like   and  , the range of genres being explored is vast. '
            'Globally, filmmakers are learning as they experiment with '
            'different types of stories. But in Pakistan, there’s little '
            'diversity in films. This lack of variety is one of the many '
            'factors that have contributed to the decline of cinemas, leaving '
            'once-vibrant spaces desolate and empty. It’s not just the '
            'physical doors of these theatres that have closed — it’s an '
            'entire communal experience that once unified society that is '
            'slowly disappearing. Will it ever return, or has cinema culture '
            'in Pakistan been lost for good?',

            'Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X. “Kamal Adwan Hospital in '

            'His whereabouts are unknown. We call for his immediate release.” '
            'Israel’s military said on Sunday that its forces had killed '
            'approximately 20 Palestinians and apprehended 240 in the raid, '
            'calling it one of its “largest operations” conducted in the '
            'territory. The military also said forces had detained Abu '

            'Tedros said the patients in critical condition at Kamal Adwan had '
            'been moved to the Indonesian Hospital, “which is itself out of '
            'function”. “Amid ongoing chaos in northern Gaza, WHO and partners '

            'water to Indonesian Hospital and transferred 10 critical patients '
            'to Al-Shifa Hospital,” he said. “We urge Israel to ensure their '
            'health care needs and rights are upheld.” He said seven patients '
            'along with 15 caregivers and health workers remained at the '
            '“severely damaged” Indonesian Hospital, “which has no ability to '
            'provide care”. “Al-Ahli Hospital and Al-Wafa Rehabilitation '
            'Hospital in Gaza City also faced attacks today and both are '
            'damaged,” Tedros added. “We repeat: stop attacks on hospitals. '
            'People in Gaza need access to health care. Humanitarians need '
            'access to provide health aid.” The International Committee of the '

            'had been “obliterated” by fighting in the conflict, with '
            'hospitals rendered “completely inoperable”. “Repeated hostilities '
            'in and around hospitals have obliterated the healthcare system in '
            'northern Gaza, putting civilians at an unacceptably grave risk of '
            'going without lifesaving care,” the ICRC said in a statement. It '
            'called for the respect and protection of medical facilities in '

            'legal obligation and a moral imperative to preserve human life,” '
            'it added, saying hospitals were a lifeline for those sick or '
            'wounded in conflict. The Al-Awda Hospital, previously supported '
            'by the ICRC with supplies, was now absorbing more pressure as one '
            'of the few functioning medical facilities in northern Gaza, the '

            'committed to supporting healthcare services wherever possible, '
            'including doing what it could to ensure the protection of medical '
            'responders and civilian access to health care, as well as '
            'facilitating movements of medical personnel and equipment. The '

            'Eco\xadnomic Transforma\xadtion Plan 2024-29 today (Tuesday), '
            'Pla\xadn\xadning Minister Ahsan Iqbal announced during a ceremony '
            'on Monday. The five-year plan aims to address key economic '
            'challenges thro\xadugh a targeted framework called the “Five Es” '
            '— Exports; E-Pakis\xadtan; Equity and Empo\xadwerment; '
            'Environment, Food and Water Security; and Energy and '

            'Specialised Trai\xadn\xading Programme of the Pakistan '
            'Administrative Service in Lahore, the minister said, “We '
            'exa\xadm\xadined the key challe\xadnges Pakistan has faced in the '
            'past 16 months and identified the priorities required to '
            'establish a stable foundation. This led to the development of the '
            'Five Es Frame\xadwork to address our core challenges.” He '
            'elaborated that the framework includes expanding and diversifying '
            'exports to make export-led growth a cornerstone of economic '
            'development, harnessing the power of digital transformation to '
            'turn Pakistan into a techno-economy, ensuring environmental, food '
            'and water security to achieve sustainability, focusing on energy '
            'efficiency and affordability, and building multi-modal transport '
            'corridors. The framework also “pro\xadmotes equity, ethics and '
            'empowerment for val\xad\xadues-based growth, '
            'foc\xad\xadu\xad\xadsing on youth and wom\xaden as drivers of '
            'future progress”, he added. Addressing civil servants, Mr Iqbal '
            'emphasised their critical role in addressing Pakistan’s '
            'challenges and shaping its future. “Civil service is not just a '
            'profession; it is a mission,” he said. The minister identified '
            'peace, political stability, policy continuity and commitment to '
            'reforms as key factors for sustainable development. “Governments '
            'will come and go, but civil servants are the constant force '
            'steering the nation towards progress,” he said, urging officers '
            'to maintain integrity and a reputation of excellence. He '
            'encouraged them to reflect on how other nations have outpaced '
            'Pakistan in development and called for a unified approach to '
            'overcome the country’s challenges. “If we aim to achieve an '
            'honourable position by 2047, civil servants must commit to these '
            'factors,” he added. Meanwhile, the planning minister hailed the '
            'Chashma Nuclear Power Project Unit-5 (C-5) as a milestone in '
            'Pakistan-China   during the project’s first concrete pouring '
            'ceremony in Mianwali on Monday. He highlighted nuc\xadlear '
            'energy’s pivotal role in addressing Pakistan’s energy challenges. '
            '“Cur\xadr\xadently, our nuclear power plants contribute over '
            '3,530MW to the national grid, offering clean and affordable '
            'electricity,” he said. The addition of C-5, with a 1,200MW '
            'capacity, will further str\xade\xadngthen Pakistan’s ene\xadrgy '
            'mix, reducing reliance on imported fuels. He emphasised the '
            'sig\xadn\xadificance of the China-Pakistan Economic Corr\xadidor '
            '(CPEC) in fostering regional connectivity and economic growth. '
            '“CPEC is more than a collection of projects — it symbolises the '
            'unbreakable bond between Pakis\xadtan and China,” he said. Mr '
            'Iqbal also advoca\xadted for joint ventures be\xadt\xadween '
            'Pakistan and China to design and produce nu\xadc\xadlear power '
            'pla\xadnts for global markets, unlocking new economic '
            'opportunities. Under the Five Es framework, the National Economic '
            'Transformation Plan emphasises turning Pakistan into a '
            '“techno-economy”, he said. This includes integrating artificial '
            'intelligence, nanotechnology and automation into economic '
            'development. The strategy also prioritises equity and '
            'empowerment, focusing on youth and women as drivers of future '
            'progress. Highlighting the transition to sustainable energy, Mr '
            'Iqbal reaffirmed nuclear energy’s role in the country’s strategy. '
            'He lauded the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority for ensuring '
            'safety standards and compliance with international protocols. '
            '“Safety is paramount to the success of our nuclear programme,” he '
            'said, adding that such projects demonstrate Pakistan’s potential '
            'as a reliable partner in large-scale infrastructure and '
            'technological collaborations. Through the Five Es, the government '
            'aims to build a resilient foundation for economic growth and '
            'secure a sustainable future for Pakistan. The event was also '

{'author': 'Arifa Noor',
 'category': None,
 'content': 'IN the days and weeks of ‘ ’, there is advice aplenty for what '
            'the PTI and Imran Khan can or have to do. The government is ready '
            'to talk and has lots to offer. One assumes it will offer relief '
            'from the various cases against the PTI leadership and freedom for '
            'those in jails though there may not be much in terms of the '
            'resolution of the election controversies. But for this to happen, '
            'the wise old and middle-aged men (whose ears are on the ground in '
            'Pindi) explain that Khan and the PTI will have to wave the white '
            'flag, in no uncertain terms. The   will have to be   and Khan '
            'will also have to take a ‘chill pill’.      This means he will '
            'have to accept the set-up which resulted from the 2024 results '
            'for the time being — there is some vague talk of the two sides '
            'coming to an agreement on an early election but the chat about '
            'this is as promising as new year resolutions. Concrete decisions '
            'and dates will have to wait till the PTI displays good behaviour '
            'and is then allowed to emerge from the corner it was banished to. '
            'All this back and forth, important as it sounds, is missing the '
            'wood for the trees. Indeed, discussions on Pakistani politics can '
            'be so focused on personalities that little else seems to matter. '
            'So at times the clash is between the military chief and a '
            'politician and at other times it is about political leaders. And '
            'these days, any political crisis is seen to be the result of '
            'Imran Khan’s clash with one or the other player and hence the '
            'resolution also depends on the PTI head honcho making peace with '
            'the others. But this diagnosis and its prescription seems to '
            'ignore the real crisis — of the people. Discussions on Pakistani '
            'politics can be so focused on personalities that little else '
            'seems to matter. In fact, it is important to emphasise that Imran '
            'Khan, in some ways, is the symptom and not the cause of our '
            'political crisis. The crisis is the result of a stagnating '
            'economy, demography and a rapacious elite, which has turned the '
            'populace  , where it now identifies with Khan or identifies Khan '
            'as someone who will change the status quo because everyone else '
            'happens to be in power.      So the question to be asked is: what '
            'will happen to this support and the people’s anger once Khan too '
            'is inside the tent? If the voters can dump Nawaz Sharif after his '
            'change of strategy, why will they not turn their back on the PTI '
            'and Khan? More importantly, how will they then channel their '
            'anger? In the long term, this is of far more importance than any '
            'party or leader. As it is, there is a growing sense of '
            'hopelessness among the people at large. Take a recent outburst by '
            'noted actor Waseem Abbas in a clip that went viral. Or the '
            'comments by celebrated author Mohammed Hanif in a talk show where '
            'he said the real   (tragedy) had already happened as he described '
            'the despondency among young people that he encountered at '
            'educational institutes. This will not be addressed by '
            'neutralising Imran Khan (or uniformed officials going to higher '
            'education institutes for lectures) but might just add to the '
            'existing grievances. For disappointment in another mainstream '
            'political party is not going to mean popular support will turn to '
            'other political parties or the establishment. Instead, it will '
            'opt for more radical, non-parliamentary options. This can mean, '
            'at best, organisations which focus on protest rather than '
            'elections such as the PTM or those which advocate violence '
            'against the state. If those in power want to address the real '
            'crisis they need to look beyond the PTI. The aim should not be to '
            'shut up the opposition, be it Khan or anyone else, but to address '
            'the legitimacy crisis. For without this, the state will have to '
            'continue to resort to violence which is counterproductive '
            'eventually. This was already evident in the crackdown after May '
            '9, which worked for a short while but by last month in D-Chowk '
            'the violence had to be escalated. And to assume this will be the '
            'end would be dangerous — more dangerous than the assumptions in '
            '2016 that Donald Trump was over. Neither will this crisis of '
            'legitimacy end by co-opting the PTI because it will — to repeat — '
            'simply place it among the parties that are to be distrusted '
            'because of their role as a partner of the state; in fact, the '
            'anger against the PTI in KP is evidence of this. It is only when '
            'the legitimacy crisis is over that the country can begin to carry '
            'out economic reform by taking some difficult decisions, which do '
            'far more than simply increase the burden on the people. If the '
            'past decade or so have taught us anything it should be that weak '
            'and/or illegitimate governments cannot carry out reform. They are '
            'far too busy shoring up their weak government by securing their '
            'own interests and those of the people or sectors which prop it '
            'up. This is the main reason neither the PTI nor the PML-N were '
            'able to take any ‘difficult’ decision other than burden the '
            'people. And this will not change in the coming days; the '
            'government will neither take steps to broaden the tax base nor '
            'will it be in a position to reduce expenses. Instead, it will '
            'continue to favour special interests such as real estate, the '
            'traders, and journalists and give increments to the bureaucracy '
            'and judiciary, the support of which is needed to suppress '
            'dissent. At the same time, this will require those in power to '
            'first pay some price themselves. But in order to work on the real '
            'crises (economic and political), the obsession with personalities '
            'has to end.',

 'content': 'IT’S not difficult to suppose that prisoners also celebrate the '
            'New Year, including those on death row. With the advent of the '
            'means to annihilate all life on planet Earth, the entire human '
            'race has been put on death row. It seems we are all on death row, '
            'like inmates living on borrowed time, and without being given a '
            'fair trial. I have been riveted to daily discussions involving '
            'well-informed ex-CIA analysts, senior military personnel who '
            'retired after serving US interventions across the world and '
            'highly respected American academics. These discussants keep an '
            'equal distance from Joe Biden and Donald Trump, analysing 2024, '
            'and looking forward to the post-Jan 20, 2025, world. Their '
            'discussions on the global tensions point to the death sentence '
            'many in the world dread but which most are not even aware of, and '
            'a large number are not interested in knowing about. It’s fraught '
            'and could be carried out any time. The West, in their view, is in '
            'an economic and political mess and itching for a fight with '
            'Russia, China and their allies. What happens when the bomb '
            'explodes? If you’re in the vicinity, you’ll not live to know. The '
            'West’s growing team of opponents, on the other hand, have an '
            'economic agenda that questions the hegemony of the greenback. The '
            'American discussants see the Ukraine war as an outcome of US '
            'provocations, the threat to take Nato to Russia’s borders. A '
            'slight misjudgement or even an eerily suicidal resolve could '
            'trigger a nuclear apocalypse. Gaza is the other trigger as Israel '
            'seeks to move on from the massacres to the virgin Syrian turf. It '
            'has prompted Iran and Saudi Arabia to go into a huddle. A '
            'behind-the-scenes factor overrides these and similar '
            'possibilities. Indications are that a vicious conflict is '
            'likelier to break out to thwart the rise of BRICS. The ruse would '
            'come from Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Syria, and Israel, principally. '
            'China, with a significant interest in a peaceful world in which '
            'it could ply the Belt and Road trade, is seen as the least likely '
            'to want war. But it would respond to provocations with full force '
            'of its astounding military capabilities if it came to that. '
            'That’s what leading American analysts believe. Israel, '
            'particularly Netanyahu’s Israel, has emerged as having a devious '
            'interest in triggering a catastrophe, and it cares little if it '
            'sets off a nuclear disaster. It is pining to attack Iran, '
            'underplaying the imminent response with Iran’s conventional '
            'capabilities that could destroy the Zionist state. Israel is '
            'known to have the US carte blanche to do as it pleases. In which '
            'case, Vladimir Putin is not likely to merely look on. Russia’s '
            'newly minted nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile is '
            'supposed to have the speed and force to destroy most of Europe '
            'with chilling ease. Nato retribution would be equally swift and '
            'devastating, which would leave a few pleased individuals in the '
            'nuclear bunkers in Washington, D.C. The neocons, according to the '
            'analysts, had shaped the Biden administration’s rapacious support '
            'for the massacres in Ukraine and the Middle East. They look '
            'primed to have the ear of Donald Trump. Scott Ritter, respected '
            'former military damage assessor, has been canvassing support '
            'against nuclear adventurism by the US. He met Congressmen and '
            'wondered if they saw Russia’s new threat with the Oreshnik '
            'missile as a bluff. The Congressmen told him the CIA assessed it '
            'as not a bluff, but the mainstream media masked it with '
            'half-truths. Joe Biden, principally the neocon cabal around him, '
            'was ready for nuclear war with Russia. The Congressmen were '
            'alarmed that Biden would consider such a step without consulting '
            'them. Everything is up in the air. Small mercies that '
            'nuclear-armed India and Pakistan do not figure high in the list '
            'of the terrifying prospects. With Narendra Modi in the saddle '
            'though it’s difficult to predict what he would not do to remain '
            'in power. North Korea expectedly is in the heart of the bleak '
            'scenario. To the discussants, it seemed the annihilation was set '
            'for 2024. The idea was to provoke Putin before Trump took over. '
            'But we survived it. Or have we? The fear spurred me to reach for '
            'Annie Jacobsen’s chilling and acclaimed new book tersely called '
            'Nuclear War: a Scenario. It probes the prospects of nuclear '
            'exchange and the prohibitive consequences it entails for human '
            'beings. In her scenario, the disarray at the hub of '
            'decision-making was telling, with literally six minutes for the '
            'US president to respond to an assumed North Korean nuclear '
            'missile heading towards the US homeland. Based on interviews with '
            'former dramatis personae that handled Doomsday triggers, '
            'Jacobsen’s inputs came from “presidential advisers, cabinet '
            'ministers, nuclear weapons engineers, scientists, soldiers, '
            'airmen, special operators, Secret Service, emergency management '
            'experts, intelligence analysts, civil servants, and others who '
            'have worked in these scenarios over decades”. What happens when '
            'the bomb explodes? If you’re in the vicinity, you’ll not live to '
            'know. The likely chance is you would vaporise in a fraction of a '
            'second. “A 1-megaton thermonuclear weapon detonation begins with '
            'a flash of light and heat so tremendous it is impossible for the '
            'human mind to comprehend,” says Jacobsen. “One hundred and eighty '
            'million degrees Fahrenheit is four or five times hotter than the '
            'temperature that occurs at the centre of the Earth’s sun.” In the '
            'first millisecond after the bomb strikes the Pentagon, according '
            'to the author’s scenario, there is light. The light superheats '
            'the surrounding air to millions of degrees, creating a massive '
            'firestorm that expands at millions of miles per hour. Assuming '
            'the North Korean missile hits the Pentagon, “everything inside '
            'its 6.5 million square feet of office space explodes into '
            'superheated dust from the initial flash of light and heat, all '
            'the walls shattering with the near-simultaneous arrival of the '
            'shockwave, all 27,000 employees perishing instantly.” It’s '
            'immaterial if we’re in prison or out. We’re all on death row. '
            'Happy New Year.',
