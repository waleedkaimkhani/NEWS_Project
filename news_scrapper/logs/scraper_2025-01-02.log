 'content': 'KARACHI: After 17 years, an antiterrorism court has sentenced two '
            'men, including a retired major, to life in prison for abducting a '
            'businessman and extorting a total of Rs16 million in ransom.   '
            'The ATC-XVI judge found retired major Nawazish Akbar and civilian '
            'Naveed Khan — who appeared on bail — guilty of abducting Sher '
            'Bahadur when he was returning from the district Malir court in '
            '2006 and received Rs7m in cash and jewellery worth Rs9m on in '
            'ransom.   The court also sentenced them to three years for '
            'wrongful confinement, seven years for robbing the victim’s car, '
            'and sentenced them additional life imprisonment under Section 7 '
            'of the Anti-Terrorism Act.   The court also directed the '
            'forfeiture of the convicts’ property.  According to state '
            'prosecutor Muhammad Raza, the complaint was lodged against the '
            'abductors, one and a half years after the incident, following the '
            'directions of the session court.   In the FIR, the complainant '
            'stated that the accused, Nawazish, was a five per cent business '
            'partner of his brother Sher Bahadur, who owned a construction '
            'company.   After a business dispute, both parties reached a '
            'compromise, and Nawazish signed a written agreement with an '
            'assurance to settle the outstanding amount.   However, instead of '
            'paying the amount, Nawazish allegedly threatened his brother with '
            'dire consequences.   On June 6, 2006, when the complainant and '
            'his brother (abductee) were returning from Malir Court in their '
            'car, the accused, Nawazish, along with his accomplices Haji '
            'Zaman, Amir Khan, Fareed Ahmed, Naveed, and Nadeem, intercepted '
            'their vehicle. They abducted his brother, took him to an unknown '
            'location, and informed the complainant that his brother would be '
            'released after resolving the dispute.   In the detailed order, '
            'the court reproduced the detailed testimony of the abductee to '
            'understand the sequence of events.   In his testimony, the '
            'complainant stated that he had established a construction company '
            'in 2004 and gave a five per cent share to his employee, '
            'Nawazish.   He claimed that upon his return to the country the '
            'following year, an audit revealed financial misappropriation by '
            'Nawazish and another employee Naveed. Both the accused allegedly '
            'submitted written declarations acknowledging their actions and '
            'apologising for the embezzlement.   However, he further alleged '
            'that months later, these two employees conspired against him and '
            'led to his arrest in the Rs5m cheque dishonour case.   During his '
            'judicial remand, he claimed that the accused took over his office '
            'premises “illegally”. Subsequently, he terminated the services of '
            'both Nawazish and Naveed over allegations of fraud.   Describing '
            'his six-month in captivity, the victim alleged that the accused '
            'confined him to a room where co-accused Haji Zaman and Aamir, '
            'said to be associated with Taliban, attempted to make him a '
            'suicide bomber.   During this period, he stated that Nawazish '
            'frequently visited the place. He later discovered that Nawazish '
            'had transferred 95pc of the company’s shares to Haji Zaman and '
            'sold assets worth Rs20m.   He further claimed that after his '
            'release on medical grounds, he filed petitions in the Sindh High '
            'Court in 2008 and 2014, seeking the arrest of the accused and '
            'recovery of his assets.   After filing petitions in the court, he '
            'claimed that he was taken into custody where he was forced to '
            'sign the alleged agreement with a business group. While '
            'submitting the agreement in court, the victim claimed he was '
            'compelled to pay Rs1m per month to continue developing the '
            'project.   According to his statement, he ultimately sold the '
            'project for Rs500m, though its actual value was Rs18 billion.   '
            'The court noted that both accused persons did not deny the '
            'declarations, adding that prima facie “they have committed '
            'misappropriation/fraud of Rs7,000,000, which they have to return '
            'to the abductee, so their conduct itself proves that they were '
            'involved in the fraud or cheating in his company.”  Regarding the '
            'delay in submission of the challan, the court observed: “The '
            'involvement of influential individuals, notably the accused '
            'Nawazish Akbar, a retired Major, contributed to the delay, '
            'further evidenced by the prolonged delay of 17-18 years in '
            'submitting the challan.”   It further noted that the victim had '
            'provided details of being “pressured, threatened, and blackmailed '
            'into signing business agreements and transferring assets under '
            'duress. His testimony was supported by over 700 pages of '
            'documentary evidence, which detailed the extent of the financial '
            'exploitation he endured”.',

 'content': 'A report by The Washington Post published on Tuesday revealed '
            "that India's external intelligence agency, the Research and "
            'Analysis Wing (RAW), executed a covert assassination program '
            'targeting approximately half a dozen individuals in Pakistan '
            'starting from 2021. The investigative report, based on interviews '
            'with Pakistani and Indian officials and families, and a review of '
            'police records and other evidence, revealed an ambitious plan '
            'with operations resembling those conducted in North America. One '
            'of the detailed cases was the attack on Amir Sarfraz Tamba. The '
            'Post described it as "the most recent example of what Pakistani '
            'officials call a striking development" in India\'s cross-border '
            'terrorism. The report claimed that RAW, since 2021, initiated a '
            'methodical programme targeting individuals deep within Pakistan. '
            '"India\'s intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing '
            '(RAW), has since 2021 deployed a methodical assassination program '
            'to kill at least a half dozen people deep within Pakistan, '
            'according to Pakistani and Western officials," the Post article '
            'read. The article said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi '
            'portrayed himself as the most resolute and confrontational leader '
            'against India\'s adversaries since independence. "Since last '
            "year, India's relations with Western governments have been rocked "
            'by allegations that RAW officials also ordered the assassination '
            'of Sikh separatists in Canada and the United States - operations '
            'that appeared to be an outgrowth of a campaign first tested and '
            'refined in Pakistan," the Post added. The alleged programme, '
            'according to Pakistani and Western officials, utilised local '
            'petty criminals or Afghan operatives instead of Indian nationals '
            'to carry out killings, ensuring deniability. RAW officers '
            'reportedly worked through intermediaries, employing siloed teams '
            'to conduct surveillance, execute assassinations and channel '
            'payments through informal banking networks known as hawalas. "To '
            'aid deniability, RAW officers employed businessmen in Dubai, as '
            'intermediaries and deployed separate, siloed teams to surveil '
            'targets, execute killings and funnel payments from dozens of '
            'informal, unregulated banking networks known as hawalas set up in '
            'multiple continents, according to Pakistani investigators. '
            'However, The Post highlighted instances of "sloppy tradecraft and '
            'poorly trained contractors," drawing parallels with RAW\'s '
            'operations in the West. "The Sikh separatists who were targeted '
            'in Canada and the United States, Hardeep Singh Nijjar and '
            'Gurpatwant Pannun, were also designated as terrorists by India, '
            'although Western officials and analysts have disputed the '
            'persuasiveness of the Indian evidence against them," it added. '
            'The Post noted that ISI Director General Nadeem Anjum raised '
            "concerns about RAW's activities with CIA Director William J. "
            'Burns in 2022, well before allegations from Canada and the US '
            'surfaced. "Our concerns arose independent of the US and Canadian '
            'investigations," said a current Pakistani official. "Can India '
            'rise peacefully? Our answer is no." However, Indian officials '
            'declined to comment, maintaining their longstanding stance of '
            'neither confirming nor denying involvement in such killings. '
            "India's Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment on the "
            "Post's article. The article disclosed that around the same time, "
            'a RAW officer in New Delhi, Vikash Yadav, allegedly orchestrated '
            'an assassination attempt on Sikh separatist Pannun in New York, '
            'as detailed in a US federal indictment. Yadav reportedly directed '
            'his agent, businessman Nikhil Gupta, to hire a local assassin. '
            'Like Ansari, Yadav operated remotely, appeared under time '
            'pressure, and made remarks suggesting a broader plan to eliminate '
            'multiple targets. "But unlike in Pakistan, US prosecutors said '
            'the New York plot was quickly foiled after Gupta unwittingly '
            'asked a DEA informant to introduce him to a hit man." "Canadian '
            'officials, at the same time, said they also uncovered a sprawling '
            'Indian campaign to surveil, intimidate and even kill Sikhs. While '
            'criminal elements were employed, as in Pakistan, Indian diplomats '
            'stationed in Canada were also enlisted to monitor members of the '
            'Sikh diaspora, according to Canadian officials, who cited the '
            "diplomats' private electronic conversations and text messages. "
            'It\'s unclear how those conversations were obtained." The report '
            "tied RAW's tactics in Pakistan to similar operations abroad, "
            'including an alleged assassination attempt on Sikh separatist '
            'Pannun in New York, outlined in a US federal indictment. While '
            "RAW's methods succeeded in Pakistan, the report stated, attempts "
            'in the West, like the New York plot, were foiled due to improved '
            'counterintelligence by Western law enforcement. The article noted '
            'that Christopher Clary, a political science professor at the '
            "State University of New York at Albany, compared RAW's record of "
            "targeted killings to that of Israel's Mossad. He highlighted that "
            'while Mossad successfully executed assassinations in '
            'less-developed nations, its agents were caught on hotel '
            'surveillance cameras during a 2010 operation targeting a Hamas '
            'leader in Dubai. "One read is [the RAW] had been succeeding in '
            'Pakistan for a full year before they start developing this effort '
            'in the West," Clary said. "But the tactics, techniques and '
            "procedures that worked pretty well in Pakistan didn't necessarily "
            'work in the West." The report highlighted an operation involving '
            'Shahid Latif. Following his assassination, Pakistani officials '
            'raided a Dubai safe house, uncovering intelligence but failing to '
            'capture the Indian operatives allegedly involved. The raid on an '
            'Indian Air Force station hindered the diplomatic efforts between '
            'Modi and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif. The article '
            'reported that this time, RAW encountered a different kind of '
            'backlash. Following his arrest, Umair admitted he had been sent '
            'from Dubai to personally assassinate Latif after multiple failed '
            'attempts by his co-conspirators. According to two sources '
            'familiar with the case, Umair disclosed the location of a safe '
            'house in Dubai, prompting Pakistani agents to raid the apartment. '
            'While they uncovered valuable intelligence, the two Indian '
            'occupants, Ashok Kumar Anand Salian and Yogesh Kumar, were not '
            'found. (Umair was unavailable for comment.) Pakistani Foreign '
            'Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi publicly accused India of '
            'orchestrating the killings, presenting evidence of forged '
            'passports. India dismissed the claims as "false and malicious '
            'anti-India propaganda." "Until that point, Pakistan had rarely '
            'acknowledged the Indian operations. But at a news conference in '
            'February, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi '
            'held up scans of passports belonging to Salian and Kumar and '
            'accused them of directing the murders of Latif and of Riyaz one '
            'month earlier." The article noted that in April, Salian made his '
            'sole public appearance in an interview with a pro-government '
            'Indian television channel. Seated in a sparsely furnished New '
            'Delhi apartment and wearing dark sunglasses indoors, he claimed '
            'to be an ordinary Dubai-based business owner. Salian said he had '
            'employed a Pakistani worker at his cyber café who might have '
            'acted independently and denied any connections to RAW. "After '
            'Pakistan arrested him, they must have seen who was his sponsor in '
            'Dubai," Salian said. "I feel aggrieved that my details are being '
            'highlighted and my reputation damaged." Indian media outlets '
            'reportedly celebrated the assassinations, with broadcasts '
            "glorifying RAW's reach. Prime Minister Modi, during a campaign "
            "rally, implied India's willingness to strike its enemies at home "
            'or abroad. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, named in Canadian '
            'investigations, remarked, "Whoever did the killings, what\'s the '
            'problem?" Srinath Raghavan, an Indian military historian and '
            "former army officer, noted that Modi's government has promoted a "
            'narrative of a "New India," using covert operations to project '
            'strength domestically and signal toughness to Pakistan. The '
            'former military officer was quoted as saying that the Modi '
            'government has highlighted special forces raids inside Pakistan '
            "and promoted Bollywood films that glorify India's covert "
            'operatives. "The whole tagline is, \'This is the New India,\'" '
            'Raghavan said. "The Modi government came in with the view that '
            'you need to strike back, and you need to signal publicly that '
            "you're doing it. It's aimed at telling Pakistan that we're "
            'willing to come and hit hard, but it also has a domestic '
            'component." However, analysts believe that Indian officials have '
            'clearly demonstrated their extensive and deadly reach to both '
            'Pakistan and the Indian public.',

{'author': 'Khurram Husain',
 'category': None,
 'content': 'IN terms of getting its talking points right, the government’s   '
            'plan works. But sift through the details and very little of it is '
            'convincing. There is much to discuss in it, much to talk about, '
            'but when it comes to getting things done, the plan is certainly '
            'trying too hard. Consider how it talks about exports, for '
            'example. The plan says exports are to be made the driving force '
            'of the economy and the total volume of exports should rise to $60 '
            'billion in four years. To do this, the plan proposes six '
            'bullet-pointed items that include gems such as ‘Enhance '
            'Pakistan’s national brand’. Under this item, the authors of the '
            'plan say “we will build a reputation that encourages '
            'international customers to actively seek out Pakistani products '
            'for their superior quality, consistency and reliability”. Fine '
            'words these, but a bit of a long shot don’t you think? However, '
            'let’s not be unfair here, since this particular item is sixth in '
            'a list of six items. On top of their list is IT and agriculture, '
            'which they plan or hope to take to $25bn and $13bn exports '
            'respectively. The plan doesn’t tell us how these targets are to '
            'be met in these specific sectors, but lays out a list more '
            'generally, which is a bit all over the place. It promises to '
            '“implement macroeconomic reforms” that will, among other things, '
            'raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to 13 per cent. In addition, they want '
            'to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in the export sectors, '
            '“adjust and simplify export tariffs”, make “targeted export '
            'plans”, and “promote the development of export-oriented clusters” '
            'and “accessible financing”, etc. In the middle of all this, there '
            'is a photograph of the Gwadar Business Complex building, a large, '
            'architecturally fancy and totally empty building that bears '
            'silent testimony to the wasteful use of public resources in the '
            'pursuit of delusional plans bereft of any reality. It was '
            'probably not a great idea to decorate this document with a '
            'photograph of that monument to wasteful dreams. The aims to which '
            'the plan document points are admirable, no doubt. But reading '
            'through it leaves little doubt that the authors assembled a '
            'hotchpotch of aspirational bullet-pointed items and mounted them '
            'with a whole lot of fluff, then labelled it all a ‘plan’. Now '
            'they have a list of talking points for the next three years at '
            'least, and can fill the airwaves and our ear canals with talk of '
            '“the Five Es” for years to come. These sorts of lumbering vision '
            'statements are always a waste of time. A few months ago, the '
            'government retained the services of Stefan Dercon from Oxford '
            'University to help develop a vision for economic reforms. The '
            'result was a consultant’s PowerPoint presentation dressed up as a '
            'document which urged a “whole-of-government approach” to '
            'combating the country’s myriad economic dysfunctions. And right '
            'there, the whole exercise failed. Where in the world does anyone '
            'get a “whole-of-government approach” to anything? Does it happen '
            'in the United Kingdom, where the authors of that document came '
            'from? Never mind these lumbering vision statements. Instead, '
            'focus sharply on a few areas where there is a high likelihood of '
            'success, which can unlock a cascading series of transformations '
            'in the rest of the economy. One suggestion is digital payments, '
            'something the prime minister is aware of and where he has already '
            'formed a “committee” to explore how to get to a “cashless '
            'society”. This is a good idea, except one sure-fire way to kill '
            'an idea is to send it to a committee. The architecture and '
            'technology   to promote digital payments in the country are '
            'already in place. What is needed is to push for the wider '
            'adoption of digital payments around the economy, and towards that '
            'end some very concrete suggestions have been floated by industry '
            'players who are on the committee in question. The task is to get '
            'moving on this, and not to discuss it endlessly. Another area is '
            'renewable energy, especially solar. A revolution is sweeping the '
            'world, which is transforming how electricity is produced and '
            'consumed, and Pakistan is marching rapidly with it as solar '
            'panels proliferate at an impressive speed. The idea is to '
            'catalyse this process, indigenise it, and explore possibilities '
            'for the local assembly of solar panels and batteries. Much of '
            'this is already happening, with the first locally assembled '
            'electric vehicles about to hit the road in a few months. These '
            'are excellent developments and the government can help move the '
            'process along by aligning its vision for power sector reform with '
            'this ongoing revolution. The single-buyer model needs to end. The '
            'bilateral contract markets in power distribution need to be '
            'activated. Wheel\xading of bulk power needs to begin to help '
            'serve these markets. The distribution companies need to be '
            'privatised, fast-tracked, and not with an eye to fetching maximum '
            'revenues, but ensuring that monopolies in power distribution are '
            'not created, and new buyers are appropriately incentivised to '
            'invest in innovation to remain competitive. Just these two areas '
            '— digital payments and renewable energy — can produce '
            'transformative impacts on the economy, which will cascade in very '
            'important ways. Focus on these two areas with intensity and lay '
            'down measurable metrics for success. Set a target, for example, '
            'for how much turnover you want to see via digital payment '
            'platforms by 2029, and task a small, motivated team to get out '
            'there and build the roadmap for how to get there, along with '
            'Known Performance Indicators to measure progress along the way. '
            'Maybe it’s just me, but there is something to be said for small, '
            'focused efforts in a few areas, pursued with intensity, rather '
            'than large, lumbering visions across a broad front that are more '
            'likely to dissipate energy than direct it where it is most '
            'needed.',

 'content': 'As the digital woes continue unabated, the Pakistan '
            'Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has disclosed that internet '
            'shutdowns across the country are carried out on government '
            'directives, sparking a heated debate in the Senate Standing '
            'Committee on Information Technology. The revelation raised '
            'questions among the panel members about the legality and '
            'rationale behind disrupting digital access. The committee was '
            'told that Pakistan ranked 97th globally in internet speed. The '
            'session, chaired by Senator Palwasha Khan, expressed serious '
            'concerns over the ongoing issue of slow internet speeds across '
            'Pakistan and the legal ambiguities surrounding internet shutdowns '
            'and content blocking. PTA Chairman Retired Major General Hafeezur '
            'Rehman faced tough questioning from panel members over widespread '
            'complaints about internet slowdowns across the country. The PTA '
            'chairman disclosed that the authority received an average of 500 '
            'complaints daily about objectionable content on social media. "We '
            'request social media platforms to block such content, and 80% of '
            'the material is successfully removed," he explained. During a '
            'heated exchange, Senator Kamran Murtaza of JUI-F questioned the '
            'legal basis for shutting down the internet in specific areas, '
            'asking, "Which law permits this? How can you disrupt internet '
            'services without legal grounds?" In response, the PTA chairman '
            'clarified that the authority did not make such decisions '
            'independently. "The government instructs us to impose internet '
            'shutdowns. If this is illegal, why has the government been '
            'directing us to do so for the past nine years?" he asked. "I can '
            'provide exact dates and times when these shutdowns occurred." The '
            'committee members also raised concerns about the practice of '
            'shutting down internet services, particularly after receiving '
            'directives from the interior ministry. However, the PTA chairman '
            'responded that such shutdowns had been a recurring issue since '
            '2016 but were recently deemed unlawful, and added that the '
            'interior ministry must provide final legal opinions on the '
            'matter. The session also addressed the Prevention of Electronic '
            'Crimes Act (Peca), with Murtaza challenging its provisions. The '
            "IT ministry's legal representative conceded that the act does not "
            'explicitly allow internet blackouts in specific areas. However, '
            'the PTA argued that regulations empower the interior ministry to '
            'issue such directives. However, he noted the laws did not specify '
            'the blocking of internet services in any particular geographic '
            'area. Senator Murtaza criticised the impact of shutdowns, saying, '
            '"This is equivalent to pushing people into ignorance for '
            'political purposes. Education, business and library access are '
            'all disrupted when the internet is blocked." The senator raised '
            'concerns about the legality of ongoing shutdowns, if it was not '
            'clear in the law and added that the parliamentary committee '
            'should be provided a clear legal framework for such actions. The '
            'ministry\'s special secretary explained that "to block all online '
            'content in an area, internet services must be entirely '
            'suspended". The committee demanded explanations from relevant '
            'ministries. PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman also touched upon the '
            'issue of VPN regulation, revealing that only two companies had '
            'applied for VPN service licenses so far. He added that VPN '
            'services remain largely operational despite previous shutdown '
            'directives. He clarified that he had not authorised the closure '
            "of VPN services. PTI's Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand pointed "
            'out that the rules only mentioned blocking content, not entire '
            'networks. At this, Rehman countered, asking whether actions taken '
            'on Supreme Court or high court orders, including app shutdowns '
            'and internet restrictions, were also illegal. As the debate '
            'intensified, the PTA chairman said: "You\'ve all been part of the '
            'government at some point. These shutdowns were implemented under '
            'official directives." The committee was informed that increasing '
            'fiberisation was the only solution to improve internet speed, but '
            'it is the responsibility of the government to ensure its '
            'expansion. The PTA chairman highlighted that slow internet speeds '
            'would persist unless significant improvements were made in the '
            "country's digital infrastructure. The committee members later "
            'called for detailed legal opinions from the Ministries of Law and '
            'Interior, stressing the need for clarity on the overlap between '
            'rules and the broader PECA framework.',

            'to the ad-hoc salary increase that is not made part of the basic '
            'salary to avoid compounding. Instead of taking pension on the '
            'basis of the last drawn salary, the new pensioner will get '
            'pension based on the average salary of the last two years. The '
            'two pensions by one person either civilian or the military have '
            'been discontinued. The changes will take effect from January 1 '
            'and will be applicable to both the retired civil and military '
            'personnel. Many serving federal government employees, who are '
            'taking salary and pension, would also be affected by the changes. '
            "The finance ministry's notifications stated that the changes in "
            'the pension rules have been made on the basis of recommendations '
            'given by a commission constituted by the government of former '
            'prime minister Imran Khan in 2020. For the current fiscal year, '
            'the government has allocated Rs1.014 trillion in the budget for '
            'paying pensions and its lions share, as 66% or Rs662 billion has '
            'been allocated for the military pensions. There is an increase of '
            '24% in the pension bill compared to the last year, which is '
            'funded from the budget and is not sustainable. After these '
            'changes, it is expected that in the next decade the pension bill '

            'will be eligible for pension of his or her spouse in addition to '

            'all the existing instructions on the multiple pensions shall '
            'stand amended with immediate effect. Pension emoluments According '
            'to another notification, it has been decided that "henceforth, '
            'pension shall be calculated on the basis of average of '
            'pensionable emoluments drawn during last 24 months of service '
            'prior to retirement". The new instructions are applicable on the '
            'people retiring from January 1st. Currently, the pension was '

            'the impact of commuted pension, which has substantially reduced '
            'the benefits. The pensioner was entitled to claim commutation '
            'equal to 30% of the salary and for the period of seven and half '
            'years. He can still claim commutation but that amount will be '

            'was being observed across the globe, including in Pakistan, a '
            'young female lecturer and mother of three was brutally murdered '
            'by her husband in an incident of so-called honour killing in '
            'village Bakr Jamali, Sindh. The horrifying incident sent '
            'shockwaves across the area. The victim had passed the Sindh '
            'Public Service Commission examination and was working as a '
            'lecturer in the village. She belonged to a well-off and educated '
            'family. The culprit was arrested. He admitted to his crime and '
            'said he killed his wife out of ‘ghairat’ (honour). The family of '
            'the victim claimed the man killed her out of greed for money and '
            'property. The victim’s family had provided her with a good '
            'education, and allowed her to marry the person of her choice. '
            'Tragically, they received her bullet-riddled body, while three '
            'innocent little children cried for their mother. Another young '
            'woman was subjected to horrific torture before being murdered by '
            'her husband in a village in Chakwal. Two sisters were killed by '
            'their father and brother in Vehari last year for contracting '
            'free-will marriages. In Swat, 20 women were killed in the first '
            'five months of 2024. Out of these, 10 women were murdered in the '
            'name of ‘honour’. According to a recent UN report titled  : “Some '
            '51,100 women and girls were killed at home by people closely '
            'related to them in 2023, accounting for 60 per cent of all female '
            'homicides. In too many cases, victims of femicide had previously '
            'reported violence and their killings could have been prevented.” '
            'The report mentioned that, on average, 140 women and girls were '
            'killed every day by someone in their family worldwide. “This '
            'suggests that the home remains the most dangerous place for women '
            'and girls in terms of the risk of lethal victimisation.” The '
            'murder of women is taken as a mere statistic; no report, no data '
            'can capture the humiliation, pain, trauma and torture a woman '
            'goes through before she is killed by a family member. The very '
            'few cases mentioned here are enough to highlight the severity of '
            'the issue of women killed in the name of honour in Pakistan; even '
            'more painful is society’s acceptance of the practice, thus '
            'normalising murder. To address the issue, the Criminal Law '
            '(Amendment) (Offences in the name or pretext of Honour) Act, '
            '2016, was  . The qisas and diyat laws provided an option to '
            'families to forgive the culprit, who, usually, was a family '
            'member or relative, allowing criminals to go unpunished. This '
            'legal gap was addressed by the  , which eliminated the '
            'possibility of family members forgiving those who had committed '
            'the crime. This new law fixed a loophole that allowed killers to '
            'be spared punishment if the family (father, son, or brother) '
            'forgave them. The law makes the crime of honour killing a '
            'non-compoundable offence. The law included taazir as a '
            'prerogative of the court, despite the waiver of qisas by the '
            'victim’s legal heirs, with a minimum lifetime sentence. Lack of '
            'support mechanisms, family support, and shelter homes/ protection '
            'centres are contributing factors to the scourge. In such a '
            'patriarchal society, women survivors are reluctant to report '

            'slammed a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year revelers in New '
            'Orleans on Wednesday, killing at least 10 people and wounding '
            'more than 35, officials said. The FBI identified the attacker as '
            'Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old "US citizen from Texas." "An '
            'ISIS flag was located in the vehicle, and the FBI is working to '
            "determine the subject's potential associations and affiliations "
            'with terrorist organizations," the FBI said in a statement. The '
            'suspect was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire with police. '
            'Potential homemade bombs were found in his truck and around the '
            "Louisiana city's famed French Quarter, the FBI said. Local police "
            'said the incident took place at around 3:15 am (0915 GMT) in the '
            'heart of the French Quarter, which was packed with people '
            'celebrating the start of 2025. "This man was trying to run over '
            'as many people as he possibly could," Police Superintendent Anne '
            'Kirkpatrick told reporters. Driving at "very high speed" and in a '
            '"very intentional" manner, "he was hellbent on creating the '
            'carnage and the damage that he did," Kirkpatrick said. He wounded '
            'two officers in the subsequent shootout but they were listed in '
            'stable condition. The vehicle used was a white Ford F-150 '
            'electric pick-up, an AFP correspondent on the scene said. The New '
            'Orleans attack came 10 days after a similar car-ramming assault '
            'at a Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg '
            'that killed five and wounded more than 200. In that case, police '
            'arrested a Saudi man and said he appeared to be mentally '
            'disturbed. President Joe Biden called New Orleans Mayor LaToya '
            'Cantrell "to offer full federal support following the horrific '
            'news," the White House said. "There is no justification for '
            'violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any '
            'of our nation\'s communities," Biden said in a statement. '
            'President-elect Donald Trump immediately linked the attack to '
            'illegal immigration, giving no evidence and before authorities '
            'made clear the suspect was American. "When I said that the '
            'criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in '
            'the country... it turned out to be true," Trump posted on social '
            'media. Trump also claimed that the nation\'s crime rate "is at a '
            'level that nobody has ever seen." In fact, violent crime is '
            'sharply down across the country, according to the FBI. In the wee '
            "hours of the year's first day, the area would have been packed "
            'with revelers celebrating in the French Quarter, a district '
            'renowned for its bars, restaurants and jazz history. A white '
            'truck crashed through a barricade "at a very high rate of speed," '
            'witness Jim Mowrer told CBS News. "We were in the middle of the '
            'road and managed to run off the road onto the sidewalk and into '
            'the doorway of a building for cover. We did hear gunfire, saw '
            'police running," he said. "Once the gunfire stopped, we stayed in '
            'the alcove until the gunfire stopped, came out into the street, '
            'and came across a lot of\x97several people who had been hit, (we) '
            'wanted to see what we could do to help," he said. "People we came '
            'across were unfortunately deceased." New Orleans is one of the '
            'most heavily visited destinations in the United States and the '
            'incident came shortly before the city hosts the Sugar Bowl, a '
            'major college football game featuring teams from the University '
            'of Georgia and Notre Dame. It was not clear whether the game '
            'would go ahead or be postponed, but Kirkpatrick said "we are '
            'going to make sure that our routes and the Superdome are safe." '
            "Policing had already been heavy over the New Year's holiday, "
            'according to the city, as authorities braced for big crowds. The '

            'emphasising the role of technology in ensuring accurate and '
            'efficient data collection. Ceremonies were also held in several '
            'other cities, including Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar. The PBS '
            'has   7,686 enumerators and supervisors nationwide for this '
            'purpose. Data collection will take place over 40 days, from Jan 1 '
            'to Feb 10, 2025, which will be pivotal in shaping policies to '
            'address food insecurity and enhance agricultural resilience. The '
            'results are expected to be compiled by August. This census, to be '
            'conducted in collaboration with federal and provincial '
            'governments, academia and related departments, aims to provide '
            'comprehensive insights into the country’s agrarian landscape. '
            'Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal described agriculture as the '
            'backbone of the economy, significantly contributing to GDP, '
            'exports and employment. He noted that the data gathered from this '
            'census would play a vital role in shaping policies that tackle '
            'key challenges like resource management, crop patterns and food '
            'security. He further emphasised that the data would enable '
            'targeted support for the agricultural community, encouraging '
            'initiatives to increase productivity and enhance the welfare of '
            'farmers. He reiterated the federal government’s commitment to '
            'ensuring that farmers across the country receive the resources '
            'and support they need for sustainable growth. He stressed that '
            'the 7th Agricultural Census was a historic step towards economic '
            'reforms and data-driven policymaking. The minister also '
            'appreciated the modernised app\xadroach and centralised GIS '
            'technology for real-time monitoring. This will streamline data '
            'collection and analysis, enabling targeted interventions and '
            'effective resource allocation. The initiative aligns Pakistan’s '
            'agricultural practices with global standards and seeks to enhance '
            'productivity and food security. PBS’s focal person for the '
            'agriculture census, Sarwar Gondal, said that a decade overdue '
            'activity had been initiated by the bureau with its extensive '
            'network of 34 regional and 125 district offices. In Lahore, '
            'Punjab Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman inaugurated field '
            'operations for the 7th Agricultural Census during a formal '
            'ceremony held at the Chief Minister House on Wednesday. The '
            'minister inaugurated the census under the Integrated Digital '
            'Count initiative. Highlighting Punjab’s role in national '
            'agriculture, he noted that the province contributes 24pc to the '
            'country’s GDP, with 29.4 million acres of cultivated land. The '
            'data will guide policies to support farmers and optimise resource '
            'utilisation. “This initiative is a milestone in Punjab’s journey '
            'towards agricultural modernisation,” he added. In Karachi, '
            'Sindh’s Planning Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah and Livestock '
            'Minister Muhammad Ali Malkani launched the operations at the '
            'Sindh Secretariat. Sindh, with 8.2m acres of cultivated land, is '
            'a major contributor to crops like cotton, rice and sugarcane. '
            'Chief Statistician Dr Naeemuz Zafar highlighted the extensive '
            'training of 1,695 enumerators and supervisors across 30 venues in '
            'Sindh to ensure the quality of data collection. In Dadu, Deputy '
            'Commissioner Mukhtiar Ali Abro kicked off operations by marking '
            'structures as part of the census process. Covering 111 of the '
            'district’s 351 villages, the census aims to document agricultural '
            'land, livestock, and machinery. A total of 62 enumerators and '
            'nine supervisors would carry out the exercise, for which police '
            'officials had been deployed to ensure the security of census '
            'teams. Citizens were urged to cooperate with enumerators to '
            'ensure the initiative’s success. In Peshawar, Khyber '

            'rural, relying heavily on agriculture for their livelihood. With '
            'agriculture accounting for 22pc of the province’s GDP and '
            'employing 44pc of its workforce, the census aims to address '
            'challenges such as resource allocation and productivity '
            'enhancement. Tablets were distributed to crop reporting staff to '
            'support digital data collection. In Bajaur, officials launched '
            'the district’s first-ever agricultural census at a ceremony in '
            'Khar. Additional Deputy Commissioner Ali Raza underscored the '
            'activity’s significance in determining land size, crop patterns '
            'and livestock numbers. Teams will visit households across all '
            'seven tehsils to collect data digitally. Speaking on the '

            'accurate size of agriculture land, fruit and vegetable farms and '
            'cattle heads but would also help develop the agriculture sector '

 'content': 'In a major development, a peace agreement has been brokered '
            'between the warring tribes of Kurram in light of the decisions '
            'taken by the K-P apex committee. As part of the truce agreement, '
            'all bunkers in the troubled district will be demolished and '
            'weapons will be surrendered. Following the agreement, the K-P '
            'government also sprang into action and decided to open key roads '
            'leading to Kurram and initiate the movement of vehicles in '
            'caravans starting January 4. The restive Kurram district was '
            'disconnected from the rest of the country due to the precarious '
            'law and order situation which had forced the K-P government to '
            'provide food and medicine supplies through helicopter to people '
            'stranded in the area. In response to the dire situation, the apex '
            'committee meeting was held under the chair of K-P Chief Minister '
            'Ali Amin Gandapur. The meeting, attended by federal interior '
            'minister Mohsin Naqvi and senior army officials, took important '
            'decisions. The meeting was followed by a Jirga comprising members '
            'of the warring tribes. The Jirga worked towards reaching a '
            'consensus and finally an agreement containing 14 points was '
            'signed by both sides. Peace Agreement All previous collective '
            'agreements, including the Murree Agreement, and their decisions '
            'as well as tribal traditions, will remain in force. However, the '
            'members of the Kurram Peace Committee will be bound to restore '
            'peace and follow all agreements by making them more effective in '
            'the interest of the people of district Kurram. The government '
            'should take punitive action against those individual(s) who are '
            'indulged in any subversive act on government road. Besides, the '
            'village peace committees located on the road will be bound to '
            'cooperate with the government and other institutions. In case of '
            'any untoward incident, the people of the area will prove their '
            'innocence in line with local traditions and laws. In addition, if '
            'any individual(s) harboured safe haven to any unscrupulous '
            'element, such a person will be deemed as guilty under the '
            'prevailing law. As per Murree agreement, all displaced families '
            'will be settled in their respective areas whereas no hindrance '
            'will be created in their resettlement. A committee will be formed '
            'to help the displaced families. The land disputes in the district '
            'Kurram will be resolved keeping in view the ToRs of Land Revenue '
            'Commission. The commission will start working at the earliest and '
            'the Kurram Peace Committee as well as local administration will '

            'Neither the brandishing of weapons will be allowed nor will '

            'person (s) will give a personal dispute the colour of sectarian '
            'rift. Banned organizations based on sectarian hatred will not be '
            'allowed to open their offices, and legal action will be taken in '
            'case of violation. No obstacle will be created on roads and '
            'pathways of communication. All government servants, including '
            'teachers, will perform their duties in district Kurram without '
            'any interference and sense of fear. The unscrupulous elements '
            'will be punished for posting material on social media that hurt '
            'the sentiments of any of the parties. Those who support such '
            'elements will be deemed as equal partners in the crime. The peace '
            'committees will play a key role if any untoward incident occurs '
            'in any area, with the other party refraining from retaliation. '
            'Members of the village committees will cooperate in managing the '
            'situation. In case of a conflict between any two villages, the '
            'third village will not aggravate the situation, rather the peace '
            'committees of other villages will attempt to heal the rift '
            'between the feuding villages. There will be a complete ban on '
            'establishing all kinds of bunkers. Besides, all the existing '
            'bunkers will be demolished in one month. The ceasefire between '
            'the warring tribes will be long-lasting and peace efforts will '
            'continue. Meanwhile, K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur said '
            'the efforts of the provincial government have yielded positive '
            'outcome. He termed the agreement between the warring tribes an '
            'important step towards durable solution of the Kurram issue. He '
            'welcomed the development and congratulated all the participants '
            'of the peace process. He appealed to both parties to reject '
            'elements that fan hatred and disunity. Welcoming the deal, '
            'Barrister Saif, Adviser to the K-P chief minister, said one of '
            'the parties had signed the agreement a few days ago while the '
            'other party signed the instrument on Wednesday. He congratulated '
            'the people of Kurram district over the development and expressed '
            'hope that the region will usher into a new era of peace and '
            'prosperity. He said things will soon get back to normal in the '
            'area. In a related development, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) '
            'leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas announced an end to the ongoing '
            'protests across the country, following the successful agreement '
            'between the warring factions. Addressing a news conference in '
            'Islamabad, Abbas highlighted the months of hardship faced by the '
            'people of Kurram due to blocked routes. Likening the situation to '
            'Gaza, the MWM leader stated that essential supplies like '
            'medicines had been cut off and people were suffering in Kurram. '
            'He said authorities had paid little attention to their plight, '
            'which led to protests from Karachi to Gilgit-Baltistan.',

{'author': 'Khaleeq Kiani',
 'category': 'Pakistan',
 'content': 'ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday notified major reforms to '
            'the country’s pension system, abolishing multiple pensions and '
            'shifting future pensionable benefit calculations to an average of '
            'the salaries drawn over the last two years of service, instead of '
            'the last pay drawn before retirement. In a series of '
            'notifications issued on the first day of 2025, the Ministry of '
            'Finance said these changes had been   on the recommendations of '
            'the Pay and Pension Commi\xadssion-2020 (PPC) and come into force '
            'with immediate effect. These were announced as part of the '
            '2024-25 federal budget and approved by the Economic Coordination '
            'Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet in June last year for '
            'implementation with effect from July 1, 2024, but were notified '
            'after six months.      According to the first notification, '
            'henceforth “pension shall be calculated on the basis of average '
            'of pensionable emoluments drawn during last 24 months of service '
            'prior to retirement”. This puts new pensioners at a disadvantage, '
            'who were earlier entitled to such benefits on the basis of the '
            'last pay drawn on retirement. In the second order, the finance '
            'ministry said that “in the event where a person becomes entitled '
            'to more than one pension, such [a] person shall only be '
            'authorised to opt to draw one of the pensions”. This is subject '
            'to the provision that “where a federal government employee '
            'becomes entitled to a pension, such federal government employee '
            'shall be not eligible to receive such pensions”. In addition, '
            '“the in-service/pensioner spouse shall be eligible for pension of '
            'his/her spouse in addition to his/her own pay/pension”. This '
            'decision was announced in parliament by then-finance minister '
            'Ishaq Dar as part of the 2023-24 budget, but remained '
            'unimplemented due to resistance from powerful “pensioners drawing '
            'double and multiple pensions”, an official said. In yet another '
            'notification, the government also slightly curtailed the future '
            'benefits for an increase in pensions. It said “the net pension '
            '(gross pension minus commuted portion of pension) calculated at '
            'the time of retirement will be termed as baseline pension” and '
            '“any increase in pension shall be granted on baseline pension”. '
            'Also, “each increase in pension shall be maintained as a separate '
            'amount until the time the federal government decides to review '
            'and authorise any additional pensionary benefits” and the '
            'baseline pension would be reviewed by the pay and pension '
            'committee after every three years. However, the current pension '
            'of existing pensioners as of January 1, 2025 shall be treated as '
            'a baseline pension. Moreover, baseline pension is deemed to '
            'include restored commuted portion of the pension, as and when '
            'restored. It may be noted that the government has already '
            'notified a contributory pension scheme for future employees with '
            'effect from July 1, 2024 for civilians and exactly a year later '
            'for armed forces personnel. For this, the government has already '
            'established a Rs10bn pension fund through a budgetary allocation. '
            'According to the Ministry of Finance, all pension reforms were in '
            'line with recommendations of the PPC-2020 for existing '
            'pensioners/employees to curtail a future increase in pension '
            'costs without compromising on the government’s pension '
            'philosophy. It claimed that under civil service regulations, the '
            'federal government had the powers and the “right of changing the '
            'provisions in these regulations regarding pay, allowance, leave '
            'and pension, from time to time at its discretion, and of '
            'interpreting in case of dispute”. The ministry is also seeking '
            'penalties for voluntary retirement. “A federal government '
            'employee may opt for retirement after putting in 25 years of '
            'service; however, the employee shall be liable to a flat '
            'reduction rate of 3pc per year in gross pension based on the '
            'number of completed months from the date of retirement to the '
            'date of superannuation,” draft rules suggested. Such flat '
            'reduction in gross pension shall be capped at 20pc. However, this '
            'penalty would apply in cases of armed forces and civil armed '
            'forces voluntary retirement only if retirement is sought or '
            'granted prior to the prescribed rank service.',

            "at least 15 people in the territory's north on Wednesday, in what "
            'it called the first deadly attack of the New Year. "The world '
            'welcomed the New Year with celebrations and festivities, while we '
            'witnessed 2025 begin with the first Israeli massacre in the town '
            'of Jabalia just after midnight," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal '
            'told AFP. "Fifteen people were martyred and more than 20 were '
            'injured" in the attack\xa0on a house where displaced people were '
            'living, he said. The Israeli military said it was looking into '
            'the reported attack. Since October 6, the military has been '
            'conducting a major land and air offensive in northern Gaza, '
            'particularly targeting Jabalia and its adjacent refugee camp. The '
            'military says it is an effort to prevent Hamas figthers from '
            'regrouping there and it has killed hundreds of fighters, while '
            'rescuers in the area say thousands of civilians have died. On '
            'Monday, UN human rights experts said the "siege" appears to be '
            'part of an effort "to permanently displace the local population '
            'as a precursor to Gaza\'s annexation". Bassal said those living '
            'in the house were members of the Badra, Abu Warda and Taroush '
            'families who had sought refuge there. Israel warned Wednesday '
            'that it will intensify its attacks\xa0in Gaza if Hamas keeps up '
            'its rocket fire, as Palestinian rescuers reported dozens of '
            'deaths from Israeli strikes on the first day of the New Year. '
            'Over the past week, Palestinian fighters have repeatedly fired '
            'rockets at Israel, particularly from northern Gaza, where the '
            'Israeli military is conducting a major offensive. The rockets '
            'have caused little damage and have been fired in far smaller '
            'numbers than in the early stages of the war, but they have been a '
            'political blow for the Israeli government after nearly 15 months '
            'of fighting. "I want to send a clear message from here to the '
            'heads of the terrorists in Gaza: If Hamas does not soon allow the '
            'release of the Israeli hostages from Gaza... and continues firing '
            'at Israeli communities, it will face blows of an intensity not '
            'seen in Gaza for a long time," Defence Minister Israel Katz said. '

            'between Iran and three European countries will be held in Geneva '
            'on Jan 13,” said Kazem Gharibabadi, Deputy Foreign Minister for '
            'Legal and International Affairs, according to   news agency. He '
            'added the talks were only “consultations, not negotiations.” The '
            'three European countries had on Dec 17 accused Iran of growing '
            'its stockpile of high-enriched uranium to “unprecedented levels” '

            'the possibility of restoring sanctions against Iran to keep it '
            'from developing its nuclear programme. Iran’s top diplomat Abbas '
            'Araghchi said his country was “ready for fair and honorable '

            'like this path, it is natural that we follow our own path, as we '

            'in recent years increased its manufacturing of enriched uranium '

            'uranium enriched to 60 per cent, the International Atomic Energy '

            'way to the 90pc required for an atomic bomb. Iran held talks '

            'Britain, France and Germany. Those discussions, the first since '
            'the US election, came after Tehran was angered by a '
            'European-backed resolution that accused Iran of poor cooperation '
            'with the UN nuclear watchdog. Iran insists on its right to '
            'nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and has consistently denied '

 'content': 'DUBAI: Saudi Arabia has put six Iranians to death for drug '
            'trafficking, the interior ministry said on Wednesday, after a '
            'year in which it carried out a  , according to a tally of '
            'official reports. The six were executed in Dammam, on the Gulf '
            'coast, for having “clandestinely introduced hashish” into the '
            'kingdom, the ministry said in a statement carried by the official '
            'SPA news agency without specifying when. Iran summoned the Saudi '
            'ambassador to hear a “strong protest” against the “unacceptable” '
            'violation of “the rules and norms of international law”, the '
            'foreign ministry in Tehran said. “Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to '
            'Tehran was summoned,” the ministry said in a statement, adding '
            'that Tehran conveyed its “strong protest” against Riyadh’s '
            'action, which it described as “unacceptable” and a violation of '
            '“the rules and norms of international law” Saudi Arabia carried '
            'out at least 338 executions in 2024, sharply up on the 170 '
            'recorded in 2023 and the highest number in decades. Human rights '
            'group Amnesty International, which has been documenting '
            'executions in the kingdom since the 1990s, has said the previous '
            'highs were 196 in 2022 and 192 in 1995. Convicted drug '
            'traffickers made up at least 117 of those put to death last year, '
            'agency’s tally showed. There has been a flurry of executions of '
            'convicted drug traffickers since the kingdom ended a moratorium '
            'on the use of the death penalty for drug offences two years ago. '
            'In 2023, the authorities launched a highly publicised anti-drugs '
            'campaign involving a series of raids and arrests. Saudi Arabia '
            'has become a major market for the addictive psychostimulant '
            'captagon, which was produced in huge quantities in Syria during '
            'the civil war which culminated in the overthrow of longtime '
            'strongman Bashar al-Assad last month. In September, more than 30 '
            'Arab and international human rights groups denounced the “sharp '
            'increase” in executions of people convicted on drug charges. '
            'Foreigners made up 129 of the 338 people executed in 2024, '
            'another record. They included 25 Yemenis, 24 Pakistanis, 17 '
            'Egyptians, 16 Syrians, 14 Nigerians, 13 Jordanians and seven '
            'Ethiopians. In March 2022, Saudi Arabia executed 81 people in a '
            'single day for “terrorist crimes”, sparking international '
            'outrage. Only China and Iran executed more people than Saudi '
            'Arabia in 2023, according to Amnesty, which has yet to publish '
            'its 2024 figures. The Saudi authorities say the death penalty is '
            'necessary to maintain public order and is only used after all '
            'avenues for appeal have been exhausted. The kingdom severed '
            'relations with Iran in 2016 after its diplomatic missions in '
            'Tehran and second city Mashhad were attacked by protesters '
            'angered by the execution of cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Diplomatic ties '
            'were restored in March 2023, after a rapprochement brokered by '

 'content': 'LONDON: The number of irregular migrants arriving in Britain on '
            'small boats soared in 2024, data showed on Wednesday, piling '
            'pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to stem the dangerous '
            'Channel crossings. Immigration, both irregular and regular, was a '
            'major issue at July’s general election, which brought Labour to '
            'power but also saw a breakthrough for Nigel Farage’s hard-right '
            'Reform UK party. Some 36,816 people were detected in the Channel '
            'last year, a 25 per cent increase from the 29,437 who arrived in '
            '2023, provisional figures from the interior ministry showed. The '
            '2024 total, however, was still well below the record 45,774 '
            'undocumented migrants who arrived on the UK’s shores in flimsy '
            'inflatable boats in 2022. At least 76 deaths were recorded in '
            'about 20 accidents last year, making it the deadliest year for '
            'migrants who are taking ever greater risks to evade Britain’s '
            'border control. According to French officials, at least 5,800 '
            'people were rescued at sea last year and authorities prevented '
            'more than 870 attempted crossings. Starmer has pledged to crack '
            'down on the crossings after his election win returned Labour to '
            'government after 14 years in opposition. Upon entering office, he '
            'scrapped the previous Conservative government’s controversial '
            'scheme to send irregular migrants to Rwanda, branding it a '
            '“gimmick”. Instead, he has promised to “smash the gangs” of '
            'people traffickers running the crossings and has signed a number '
            'of agreements with foreign countries to co-operate on law '
            'enforcement. He has described the smuggling networks as a “global '
            'security threat similar to terrorism”. The latest figures mean '
            'last year had the second highest number of annual arrivals since '
            'data on the crossings began to be collected in 2018. More than '
            '150,000 people have arrived by boat in the last seven years in '
            'total. In the first nine months of last year, Afghan migrants '
            'accounted for the single largest group of arrivals, making up '
            '17pc of the total. People from Vietnam, Iran and Syria were the '
            'next largest groups. Vietnamese migrants appeared to fuel the '
            'surge in crossings in 2024. They made up just 5pc of arrivals in '
            '2023, well below the January-September 2024 figure of 13pc. “It’s '
            'often not possible to pin down a specific reason,” for why the '
            'numbers fluctuate, Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration '
            'Observatory at Oxford University said. “The reason that brought '
            'numbers a bit higher this year is partly there was some increase '
            'in the first half of the year, and then we’ve seen this kind of '
            'sustained increase from October, November, December, which is '
            'usually when the numbers start to settle down because the '
            'weather’s not as good”. More than 3,200 arrived in December '
            'alone, including several hundred over Christmas. Starmer has also '
            'set up a new Border Security Command and strengthened cooperation '
            'with European partners, including Europol. Britain has signed '
            'joint action plans with Germany and Iraq aimed at tackling the '
            'smuggling gangs.',

 'content': 'THE ‘home-grown’, five-year economic plan  , which was unveiled '
            'by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif this week, hopes to build on the '
            'country’s   economic   to boost growth. The initiative is based '
            'on the ruling PML-N’s five-point development agenda   to as the '
            '‘5Es Plan’. It focuses on exports, information technology, '
            'environment and climate, energy and infrastructure, and justice '
            'for all as a “unified roadmap” to make Pakistan a trillion-dollar '
            'economy — roughly triple its present size — by 2035. The roadmap '
            'aims to address key economic challenges through a ‘National '
            'Economic Transformation Plan’, providing short- to medium-term '
            'solutions for stabilisation and growth. However, the targets are '
            'ambitious, if not unrealistic, as they seek to achieve a '
            'sustainable growth rate of 6pc by 2028 and attract $10bn in '
            'private investment each year to double exports to $60bn over the '
            'next five years. But then, the state minister for finance has '
            'downplayed the focus on the plan’s targets. According to him, the '
            'plan was an effort to give the economy direction so that it does '
            'not heat up when the growth accelerator is pressed. The plan is '
            'elaborate regarding what the government desires to achieve over '
            'the five-year period but it does not offer any glimpse into the '
            'policy reforms or solutions it intends to implement to fix the '
            'problems ailing the economy. At best, it has set up a delivery '
            'unit at the Prime Minister’s Office to coordinate the '
            'implementation of sectoral plans and roadmaps with a view to '
            'executing the initiative and ensuring transparency and '
            'accountability. The nine-month track record of this government on '
            'promised structural reforms also does not inspire much confidence '
            'in its ability to follow through on its pledges. For example, we '
            'have seen the government capitulating on retail tax and SOE  . '
            'That is not all. Many of its policies run counter to Uraan '
            'Pakistan’s objectives. On the one hand, it envisages encouraging '
            'IT exports and supporting start-ups; and on the other, it has   '
            'internet speeds, despite warnings of IT export  . Furthermore, '
            'the programme points at decades of political instability, policy '
            'inconsistency, and repeated military-led disruptions in the '
            'political process as reasons for the current state of the '
            'economy. Yet, there has been little inclination to address these '
            'challenges. The absence of clear mentions of policy reforms '
            'backed by a solid strategy to execute the targets allows the '
            'bureaucracy a lot of space to wriggle out of responsibility. '
            'While monitoring and evaluation of progress on the initiative is '
            'important, they cannot be a substitute for real reforms and '
            'policy changes when it comes to fixing the economy to put it on '
            'the road to sustainable growth.',

 'content': 'KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Wednesday '
            'directed police to launch a crackdown on vehicles with fake or   '
            'from next month. Chairing a high-level meeting to review the '
            'progress of the Karachi Safe City project, the CM emphasised that '
            'the Safe City Authority should begin using facial recognition '
            'technology to identify suspicious individuals travelling in '
            'vehicles or moving on the roads beginning next month, to ensure '
            'the project’s objectives are met. The meeting, held at the Chief '
            'Minister House, was attended by Home Minister Zia-ul-Hasan '
            'Lanjar, Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah, Inspector General of '
            'Police Ghulam Nabi Memon, Sindh Safe Cities Authority director '
            'general Asif Ijaz Sheikh and other senior officials. The CM said '
            'that the initiative would improve traffic management and law '
            'enforcement. He also asked the Safe City Authority to arrange 110 '
            'emergency response vehicles to boost mobile surveillance. He said '
            'these vehicles would strengthen CCTV coverage and improve '
            'patrolling efficiency. The chief minister instructed officials to '
            'replicate the Safe City project in Hyderabad and Sukkur, '
            'extending the initiative’s benefits beyond Karachi. Officials '
            'reported that procurement of key equipment, including hardware '
            'and surveillance systems, has been completed. Over 300 poles for '
            'CCTV cameras have been installed, with foundations laid for 200 '
            'more. Speaking on the occasion, CM Shah expressed satisfaction '
            'with the project’s progress but stressed the need for timely '
            'completion. “This is a vital step toward improving public safety '
            'and curbing crime in Karachi,” he said. The Karachi Safe City '
            'project is expected to serve as a model for modern urban '

 'category': 'World',
 'content': 'WASHINGTON: Like prior lame-duck US presidents, Joe Biden has '
            'been racing to complete unfinished business in an   to bolster '
            'his legacy — and protect his signature policies — before handing '
            'over the keys to the White House. With archrival Donald Trump '
            'returning to power, Biden’s work to protect his administration’s '
            'official actions, and his own reputation, has taken on added '
            'impetus, experts say. “Departing presidents often try to both '
            'accomplish as much as they can prior to leaving office and also '
            'shape public opinion of their administration,” Robert Rowland, a '
            'University of Kansas communications professor, told  . “There are '
            'many examples of intense lame-duck periods,” particularly when '
            'power changes from party to party, said Julian Zelizer, a history '
            'professor at Princeton University. Biden, whose rare public '
            'appearances have shown him visibly physically diminished, is no '
            'exception to the rule. His recent decision to commute the '
            'sentences of 37 of the 40 federal death row inmates triggered the '
            'wrath of his Republican adversary. In response, Trump has vowed '
            'to seek to have even more defendants sentenced to death. “Biden '
            'is scared by what he fears President Trump may do,” said Rowland. '
            '“That fear is making him especially forceful in trying to limit '
            'the agenda of the incoming Trump Administration and to solidify '
            'his administration’s accomplishments,” he said. The outgoing '
            'president had previously granted 39 presidential pardons and '
            'commuted sentences for nearly 1,500 people, with the White House '
            'hailing it as “the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern '
            'history”. “All presidents use their power to pardon or commute '
            'sentences at the end of their presidencies,” Wendy Schiller, a '
            'Brown University political science professor, told  . Zelizer '
            'said the judicial actions may be motivated by Biden seeking to '
            '“honour some of the promises he made during his campaign on '
            'criminal justice.” One of his most notable decisions, however, '
            'was to  , Hunter Biden, who he said had been subjected to unfair '
            'treatment by the courts and prosecutors. The move provoked strong '
            'criticism from Trump and Republicans, but also from close '
            'Democratic allies. Rowland said the pardon has “definitely had a '
            'major negative impact” on Biden’s reputation, adding impetus to '
            'his final days’ work to shape public opinion of his outgoing '
            'administration. Another one of Biden’s pledges was to take action '
            'on student debt owed by millions of Americans. Days before '
            'Christmas, the outgoing president announced student debt '
            'cancellation for 55,000 public service workers. That brought “the '
            'total number of individuals who have been approved for student '
            'debt relief under my Administration to nearly five million people '
            'through various actions,” Biden said. For Rowland, “the most '
            'striking decision” by Biden in his final days has been the '
            '“effort to get as much aid to Ukraine as possible before Trump '
            'becomes president.” In December, Washington anno\xadunced four '
            'new shipments of military equipment to Kyiv, worth several '
            'billion dollars, to aid in the country’s fight against Russia’s '
            'invasion. While it is still uncertain what Trump’s policy will be '
            'toward Ukraine once he is in the Oval Office, the Republican has '
            'voiced strong opposition to US missiles being fired into Russia, '
            'which Biden approved after the election. Biden also recently '
            'increased US commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. '
            'Trump, a noted climate change skeptic, may attempt to walk those '
            'back, with a friendly Congress at his side. The White House and '
            'Democrats in the Senate — which is set to flip to Republican '
            'control, along with the House of Representatives — have been '
            'working to quickly confirm as many judges as possible. Biden has '
            'made appointing diverse candidates to the federal bench a '
            'priority, including by naming the first Black woman to the '
            'Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, during his term. In all, at '
            'least 235 federal judges have been confirmed by the Senate during '
            'Biden’s four years in office, a record for a single term since '
            'the Jimmy Carter administration, the White House boasts. As '
            'Democratic-aligned groups aim to stymie the Trump agenda through '
            'the courts, Biden-appointed judges may help temporarily, though '
            'key issues may ultimately end up in the Supreme Court, where '
            'conservatives have a broad 6-3 majority.',

 'content': 'LAHORE/RAWALPINDI: More than 30 officers of the Federal '
            'Investigation Agency (FIA) have been booked and dismissed from '
            'service over their alleged collusion with   in illegally sending '
            'Pakistanis abroad. The agency began the purge last month '
            'following the   of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near '
            'Greece. As per the estimate, more than 80 Pakistanis drowned in '
            'the accident, 36 of whom were rescued. The remaining have been '
            'presumed dead. In response to the tragedy, Prime Minister Shehbaz '
            'Sharif had   the authorities to take action against human '
            'smugglers and officials aiding them. Since then, a countrywide '
            'crackdown has been launched against human smugglers, leading to '
            'the arrests of over a dozen suspects. According to the FIA, '
            'criminal cases have been filed against 13 agency officials for '
            'their alleged involvement in human trafficking. FIA Director '
            'General Ahmed Ishaq Jahangir conducted departmental hearings of '
            '49 officials implicated in boat incidents, the agency said, '
            'adding that 35 were dismissed from service. These officers '
            'included four inspectors, 10 sub-inspectors, two ASIs, five head '
            'constables and 14 constables. “The purpose of departmental '
            'accountability is to rid the organisation of corrupt elements,” '
            'the FIA DG was quoted as saying. Mr Jahangir added that strict '
            'measures were being taken against FIA officials involved in '
            'illegal activities. The FIA has claimed to have arrested four '
            'more alleged human smugglers, including a wanted criminal. The '
            'suspects included Imran Hussain alias Mani, who was wanted for '
            'allegedly sending abroad migrants who died in a boat tragedy near '
            'Libya in 2023. He was listed in the agency’s Red Book’s “most '
            'wanted” category. Other suspects were identified as Muhammad '
            'Ijaz, Imran Saqib and Rizwan Khadim, an FIA spokesperson said. '
            'The arrests were made from various areas of Gujranwala and '
            'Gujrat. The FIA spokesperson claimed Hussain was a member of an '
            'international human trafficking gang and was named in six cases '
            'registered in Gujrat. He allegedly extorted Rs2.4 million from '
            'each of the six victims of the Libya boat incident. The victims '
            'were sent from Pakistan to Egypt and Dubai on visit visas and '
            'later to Libya, where they were kept in safe houses. Later, they '
            'were placed on the Europe-bound boat, which capsized. The FIA '
            'Gujranwala zone has so far registered 32 cases and launched two '
            'inquiries against human traffickers. And 10 suspects involved in '
            'the Greek boat accident have been arrested while a crackdown was '
            'underway to arrest their accomplices, FIA said. The bodies of '
            'four more Pakistanis who died in last month’s boat tragedy have '
            'been recovered, taking the total death toll to nine. The victims '
            'have been identified as Shabbir, Zain Ali and Zeeshan of Narowal '
            'and Awais Ali of Sialkot. The bodies of three of the five '
            'Pakistanis earlier recovered from the sea have already been '
            'airlifted to Pakistan, while the remaining two will be '
            'transported on Thursday. The deceased were identified as Haji '
            'Ahmed from Mandi Bahau\xadd\xaddin, Muhammad Sufyan from Sialkot, '

{'author': 'Reuters',
 'category': 'World',
 'content': 'A driver crashed his pickup truck into a New Orleans crowd '
            'celebrating New Year’s Day and opened fire, killing at least 10 '
            'people and injuring more than 35, in an attack the FBI said it '
            'was investigating as an act of terrorism. “This man was trying to '
            'run over as many people as he could,” Police Chief Anne '
            'Kirkpatrick said at a televised press conference on Wednesday. '
            '“He was hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he '
            'did.” The incident at 2:15pm PKT (9:15am GMT) occurred at the '
            'intersection of Canal and Bourbon Streets during New Year’s '
            'celebrations, the city said in a statement. Bourbon Street is a '
            'historic tourist destination in the city’s French Quarter, known '
            'for attracting large crowds with its music and bars. Kirkpatrick '
            'said the driver fired at police and struck two police officers '
            'from the vehicle after it crashed. The officers are in stable '
            'condition, she added.\n'
            'The driver died following the shootout with police, officials '
            'said. “We know the perpetrator has been killed,” said New Orleans '
            'City Councilman Oliver Thomas. “As we search for a motive, '
            'remember there is no making sense of evil.” There was no '
            'immediate word on the driver’s identity. More than 300 officers '
            'were on duty at the time of the incident, police said. The city '
            'hosts the Sugar Bowl, a classic American college football game, '
            'each New Year’s Day, and will also be the site of the NFL Super '
            'Bowl on February 9. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell called the '
            'incident a “terrorist attack.” Alethea Duncan, an assistant '
            'special agent in charge of the FBI’s New Orleans field office, '
            'said: “This is not a terrorist event.” Later the FBI said in a '
            'statement that “we are working with our partners to investigate '
            'this as an act of terrorism.” Duncan said a suspected improvised '
            'explosive device was found and the FBI was working to determine '
            'if it was viable. A verified video taken by an onlooker shows at '
            'least two twisted bodies in the street, with one of them lying in '
            'what appears to be a puddle of blood. A bystander is seen '
            'kneeling over one of the bodies as a group of uniformed military '
            'personnel in green uniforms and carrying firearms runs past. '
            'President Joe Biden was briefed on the attack and the White House '
            'was in touch with the mayor to offer support, the White House '
            'said in a statement. A couple told   that they heard crashing '
            'noises coming from down the street and then saw a white truck '
            'slam through a barricade “at a high rate of speed”. “A horrific '
            'act of violence took place on Bourbon Street earlier this '
            'morning,” the governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry,   on X, urging '
            'people to stay away from the area where the attack took '
            'place.      The injured have been taken to at least five '
            'different hospitals, according to NOLA Ready, the city’s '
            'emergency preparedness department. The incident occurred at the '
            'intersection of Canal and Bourbon Streets during New Year’s Eve '
            'celebrations, the    .      A couple told   that they heard '
            'crashing noises coming from down the street and they then saw a '
            'white truck slam through a barricade “at a high rate of speed”. '
            'New Orleans has seen shootings and cars colliding with crowds at '
            'past parades. In November 2024, two people were killed and 10 '
            'others injured in two separate shootings along a New Orleans '
            'parade route and celebration attended by thousands, local media '
            'reported. In February 2017, a pickup truck driven by a man who '
            'police said appeared to be highly intoxicated ploughed into a '
            'crowd of spectators watching the main Mardi Gras parade in New '
            'Orleans, injuring more than 20 people.',

            'stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European '
            'Union — unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent '
            'prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit '
            'the bloc’s competitiveness. The last remaining EU buyers of '
            'Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have '
            'arranged alternative supply, while Hungary will keep receiving '
            'Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline under the Black Sea. But '
            'Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine’s '
            'neighbour Moldova also reliant on the transit flows, cut off '
            'heating and hot water supplies to households early today. Local '
            'energy company Tirasteploenergo urged residents to dress warmly, '
            'hang blankets or thick curtains over windows and balcony doors, '
            'and use electric heaters. Ukrainian President Volodymyr '
            'Zelenskiy, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said the end of '
            'gas transit through his country to Europe was “one of Moscow’s '
            'biggest defeats” and urged the US to supply more gas to Europe. '
            '“The more there is on the market from Europe’s real partners, the '
            'faster we will overcome the last negative consequences of '
            'European energy dependence on Russia,” he wrote. Europe’s “joint '
            'task” now, he wrote, was to support ex-Soviet Moldova “in this '
            'period of energy transformation”. The European Commission said '
            'the EU had prepared for the cut-off. “The European gas '
            'infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian '
            'origin,” a spokesperson for the Commission said. “It has been '
            'reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) '
            'import capacities since 2022.” Russia and the former Soviet Union '
            'spent half a century building up a major share of the European '
            'gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35 per cent. But '
            'the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy since the '
            'start of the war in Ukraine by buying more piped gas from Norway '
            'and LNG from Qatar and the United States. Ukraine, which refused '
            'to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already made the '
            'decision to abandon Russian gas. “We stopped the transit of '
            'Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its '
            'markets, it will suffer financial losses,” Ukraine’s Energy '
            'Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. Ukraine will '
            'lose up to $1 billion a year in transit fees from Russia. To help '
            'offset the impact, it will quadruple gas transmission tariffs for '
            'domestic consumers from today, which could cost the country’s '
            'industry more than $38.2 million a year. Gazprom will lose close '
            'to $5bn in gas sales. The company halted supply to Austria’s OMV '
            'in mid-November over a contractual dispute but in recent weeks '
            'Russian gas has been reaching Austria via Slovakia at a rate of '
            'around 200 gigawatt hours (GWh) per day. For January 1, only '
            'about 7 GWh per day is expected to flow from Slovakia to Austria, '
            'Austrian energy regulator E-Control said. Slovakia’s main gas '
            'buyer SPP said it would supply its customers mainly via pipelines '
            'from Germany and also Hungary, but would face additional transit '
            'costs. Combined pipeline routes from Russia delivered a record '
            'high 201bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Europe in 2018. The Nord '
            'Stream route across the Baltic Sea to Germany was blown up in '
            '2022 and the Yamal-Europe pipeline via Belarus has also shut. '
            'Russia shipped about 15 bcm of gas via Ukraine in 2023, down from '

            'justify its  . In a briefing to the Senate Standing Committee on '
            'Information Technology on Wednesday, retired Maj-Gen Hafeezur '
            'Rehman said internet shutdowns have been taking place since 2016, '
            'and their legality has been brought under question only recently. '
            'He added that the ministries of law and interior must provide a '
            'final legal opinion on this matter. During the meeting, the '
            'committee members questioned the telecom regulator’s chief over '
            'the practice of shutting down internet services, particularly on '
            'the Ministry of Interior’s orders. Senators Kamran Murtaza and '
            'Humayun Mohmand questioned the legal framework governing the '
            'blocking of internet services and social media platforms. Senator '
            'Murtaza challenged the legality of these actions, asking what law '
            'empowered the PTA to block the internet. The PTA chairman '
            'responded that the rules allowed the Interior Ministry to direct '
            'the regulator to block content or services but emphasised that '
            'the law did not specify the blocking of internet services in any '
            'particular area. Senator Murtaza said the parliamentary committee '
            'should be provided with a clear legal framework for such actions. '
            'The committee chairman, Senator Palwasha Khan, also expressed '
            'serious concerns over slow internet speeds across Pakistan and '
            'the legal ambiguities surrounding internet shutdowns and content '
            'blocking. The committee was informed that increasing the network '
            'of fibre optic cables was the only solution to improve internet '
            'speed. The committee was told that it is the responsibility of '
            'the government to ensure fibre expansion. Mr Rehman also conceded '
            'that the   would remain slow unless significant improvements were '
            'made in the digital infrastructure. He emphasised that the '
            'expansion of fibre optic networks, also known as “fiberisation,” '
            'was key to boosting internet speed. Senator Khan stressed the '
            'urgent need for better digital infrastructure, particularly the '
            'expansion of fibre optic networks, to address the issue of slow '
            'internet speeds. When asked about curbs on Virtual Private '
            'Networks (VPNs), the PTA chairman clarified he had not authorised '
            'their closure.      He further explained that the regulator had '
            'initiated the process to register VPN service providers on Dec '
            '19, and two companies have applied for licences. The regulator '
            'has introduced the new licensing category for service providers '
            'to address the problem of what officials call unregistered VPNs, '
            'as all but those proxies provided by licensed companies would be '
            'dee\xadmed unregistered and blocked. With licensed service '
            'providers, authorities would be able to monitor the VPN traffic, '
            'as anonymity provided by proxy networks has been one of the '
            'biggest gripes of the authorities. The plan envisages that local '
            'com-panies — bound by Pakistan’s laws, terms of their licences, '
            'and regulatory provisions — will provide proxy services to users. '
            'This will enable the regulator to exert more control on these '
            'companies, as opposed to the status quo, where most VPN providers '
            'are foreign companies. The committee was also briefed on PTA’s '
            'efforts to regulate social media content. Mr Rehman said the PTA '
            'receives around 500 complaints daily related to harmful or '
            'illegal content on social media platforms. “We are in continuous '
            'dialogue with social media companies to block harmful content, '
            'but there remains a significant gap in enforcement,” the PTA '
            'chairman added. The committee also called for clear legal '

            'the coming week. It was not confirmed whether any one from PPP or '
            'other coalition parties will also join the cabinet. One of the '
            'PM’s confidants, Dr Tauqir Shah, who served as principal '
            'secretary to PM in the existing and the PDM government, may join '
            'the cabinet. Dr Tauqir is currently serving in the World Bank and '
            'the PM has asked him to return to the country. Dr Tauqir, who is '
            'presently on a visit to the country, met the PM on Wednesday, a '
            'source in the PM Office told  . Among other potential candidates '
            'are Hanif Abbasi, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Barrister Aqeel Malik, '
            'and Talal Chaudhry. Talking to  , Barrister Malik, who is '
            'presently abroad, confirmed he was being given a federal '
            'ministry. He was not sure what portfolio will be given to him. '
            'Sources close to Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also confirmed his likely '
            'induction into the cabinet. According to the source, PM '
            'She\xad\xad\xadhbaz during the last parliamentary party meeting '
            'of PML-N had hinted that some new faces would be included in the '
            'cabinet and that some of the portfolios may be reshuffled. The PM '
            'is expected to meet the probable newcomers before their induction '
            'into the cabinet. Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu and Ikhtiar Wali '
            'are also believed to be under consideration for ministerial '
            'positions. It may be recalled that PM Shehbaz’s 19-member cabinet '
            'was formed on March 11, 2024. The portfolio of Attaullah Tarar, '
            'who is information minister, is likely to be changed. Prime '
            'Minister Shehbaz has already   that none of his cabinet members '
            'is getting salary and other perks under the government’s '
            'austerity measures. Earlier, PM Shehbaz, while chairing a cabinet '
            'meeting,   that Pakistan had achieved economic stability despite '
            'sabotage attempts by the opponents and had entered the growth '
            'stage. “If we want to achieve economic development, we will have '
            'to focus on export-led growth … [since] we have no other option,” '
            'he said. He said that during the first five months of the current '
            'fiscal year, remittances reached a record $15 billion and hoped '
            'it would expand to $35bn by the end of the fiscal year. The PM '
            'appreciated the efforts of his economic team for collecting an '
            'additional Rs72bn under ADR ( ), helping the government almost '
            'achieve its tax revenue target for December. He hoped that due to '
            'the $6 million funding provided by the Bill Gates Foundation, the '
            'FBR would become completely digitised. The early results of this '
            'project were that the 39 per cent time duration of container '
            'inspection had been reduced while the businessmen had got a '
            'relief of 89pc. PM Shehbaz termed beginning of Pakistan’s '
            'two-year term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security '
            'Council a significant achi\xadevement on the diplomatic front. '
            'The cabinet gave its principled approval for legislation on '
            'amendments to Section 3(7) of the Pakistan Telecommunication '
            '(Reorganisa\xadtion) Act. It also recommended approval of the '
            'regulations for the appointment of Information Group officers as '

            'borrowing declined. The current account benefited '
            'larg\xade\xad\xad\xadly from rising remittances and '
            'com\xad\xadpressed demand for imports, he added.  “The rise in '
            'KSE-100 index, however, is not a good indicator of the health of '
            'the economy as the index stocks are neither a significant '
            'percentage of the GDP, nor representative of many sectors of the '
            'economy,” Mr Malik said.  Looking ahead to 2025, there are five '
            'key watchouts. Firstly, on four previous occasions, Pakistan’s '
            'economy has enjoyed relative stability in the first year of a new '
            'IMF programme, only to see it reversed as monetary and fiscal '
            'easing triggered import-based demand which, led to balance of '
            'payment crises.  Those in government and busin\xade\xad\xadss '
            'yearning for immediate growth wou\xadld be well advised to curb '
            'their desire. The second danger, he further said, is delaying '
            'major reforms. Not only does the government need full support of '
            'its coalition partners, it has also to resolve infighting and '
            'project a clear and united leadership on issues like '
            'privatisation and right-sizing of the government.   The third '
            'watchout is failure to meet tax revenue targets, resulting in '
            'further burden on existing taxpayers, including the salaried '
            'class.   Of the three areas of FBR’s transformation plan — '
            'people, process and technology — the hardest to deal with is '
            'people and their attitude to taxpayers.  Ehsan Malik, the CEO of '
            'Pakistan Business Council, said the fifth major issue is energy — '
            'its cost, availability and reliability.   Without these, '
            'manufacturing will remain uncompetitive and the job market '
            'depressed.  Dwelling on some positives for 2025, the PBC chief '
            'said many sectors had substantial unutilised capacity which can '
            'be deployed without further capital investment and which can lead '
            'to additional employment.  “The country’s exports require better '
            'market access, but instead of pursuing new trade agreements, it '
            'must renegotiate the existing ones to obtain better terms.”  The '
            'chairman of the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajiran said “thankfully, '
            'Pakistan did not default in 2024, putting an end to a depressed '
            'environment”.    Naeem Mir said some other ach\xadievements were '
            'a current account surplus, massive rise in foreign remittances, '
            'restricting imports to below $60 billion, keeping inflation in '
            'single digit, rupee stability, improvement in foreign exchange '
            'reserves, finalisation of an IMF programme, record boom in stock '
            'exchange and bringing interest rate down to 13 per cent from '
            '22pc.  The general secretary of the All City Tajir Ittehad (ACIT) '
            'said trading and industrial activities remained 50pc below their '
            'potential in 2024, unemployment was as high as 25-30pc because of '
            'subdued sales and the industrial sector failed to record '
            'significant progress.   Mohammad Ahmed Shamsi disputed the '
            'government’s claims of a drop in food inflation, saying the '
            'ground reality belies the trumpeted decline in cost of living.   '
            '“The construction and allied ind\xadustries are struggling for '
            'survival,” Mr Shamsi said, urging the government to come up with '
            'pro-trade and industry policies in the new year for reviving the '
            'investors’ trust.  The head of Markazi Anjuman Tajiran Pakistan '
            'said the real estate sector registered a slump of 80pc during the '
            'outgoing year, followed by 70pc in the industrial sector and 60pc '
            'in retail business, owing to soaring utility bills, rise in '
            'prices of food items, high taxation and political uncertainty.  '
            'Kashif Chaudhry urged the government to take steps for improving '
            'the business environment by resolving the political impasse, '
            'improving law and order and reducing the burden of taxes on the '
            'consumer as well as businesses.  For Atiq Mir, the chairman of '
            'the All Karachi Tajir Ittehad (AKTI), 2024 was not a good year '
            'for business because political instability had shaken the '
            'investors’ confidence, leading to flight of capital.  Mr Mir was '
            'not optimistic about the coming year, too. “I do not see any '
            'economic revival during 2025 due to the government’s lack of '
            'planning, wrong decisions, political deadlock and, last but not '
            'the least, the IMF’s diktat.”',

 'content': 'ISLAMABAD: MOL Pakistan, an operator and 10 per cent shareholder '
            'in Tal Block, Kohat, has finalised the sale of gas from the newly '
            'developed Razgir field, which is 65pc owned by the state-owned '
            'entities (SOEs), to the first privately owned gas firm — '
            'Universal Gas Distribution Company Ltd (UGDCL). This enables the '
            'Islamabad-based UGDCL to acquire about 50 million cubic feet per '
            'day (mmcfd) gas for its private customers, mostly CNG stations, '
            'to be sold through a pipeline network of Sui Northern Gas '
            'Pipelines Le (SNGPL) on payment of wheeling charges. The '
            'transaction, still to be finally signed, has aggrieved other '
            'private gas distribution companies who claim the natural '
            'resource, overwhelmingly owned by the SOEs, could not be legally '
            'sold to a third party without competitive bidding. They alleged '
            'that SOE managements, under the influence of higher-ups, were '
            'facilitating the transaction instead of seeking competitive '
            'bidding for higher revenues to the government and better returns '
            'to shareholders. They also went against the 2023 Economic '
            'Coordination Committee (ECC) decision that required a bidding '
            'process. The field operator MOL has sought through Joint Venture '
            'Partners — Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL), Oil and Gas Development '
            'Company Ltd (OGDCL) having about 30pc share each and Government '
            'Holdings (Pvt) Ltd (GHPL) with 5pc stakes — consent for the '
            'signing of gas sale purchase agreement with UGDCL, according to '
            'documents seen by Dawn. Another private joint venture partner — '
            'Pakistan Oilfields Ltd (POL) with a 25pc stake — has raised '
            'questions over the lack of transparency in the transaction '
            'process. It complained in writing to all partners that it was '
            'unfair to have been kept in the dark over the negotiations or the '
            'concluded terms and learned only through outside sources despite '
            'being one of the top three majority shareholders. It demanded a '
            '“competitive bidding process” be followed for the sale of gas '
            'from Razgir field before finalising the buyer and the price for '
            'the gas “to avoid any potential complications”. None of the '
            'public sector stakeholders to the sale — Petroleum Division '
            'including Minister Musadik Malik, Secretary Momin Agha and '
            'managing directors of OGDCL, PPL and GHPL — responded to Dawn’s '
            'calls and written questions.  MOL’s Regional Vice President Ali '
            'Murtaza Abbas also did not respond to requests for comments. '
            'Sec\xadretary Petroleum, the principal accounting officer of the '
            'Petroleum Division, indirectly conveyed that only SOEs’ '
            'managements were answerable to such questions given their '
            'independence under the SOE Law. Ghias Abdullah Paracha, the chief '
            'executive officer of the UGDCL, confirmed to Dawn that the Razgir '
            'gas transaction was in process and chances were very strong that '
            'it would be executed soon.  He said five or six other companies '
            'who had acquired gas distribution licences from the Oil and  Gas '
            'Regu\xadlatory Authority (Ogra) had been sitting idle because '
            'they had other businesses but UGDCL shareholders — mostly CNG '
            'stations — had lost their past business and struggled for '
            'survival at very low margins. He said UGDCL already had signed an '
            'agreement with MOL in March 2023 for 15mmcfd gas from Mamikhel '
            'field to keep the business rolling under which “we were bound to '
            'purchase gas in future as well. This transaction is progressing '
            'under the same agreement”.  He alleged that some new players were '
            'trying only to spoil the market and had no experience in gas '
            'sales.',
